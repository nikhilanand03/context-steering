# Refusal Pipeline

This is my code for the refusal paper. Some of the files might depend on some functions from the official refusal repository. You'll have to resolve those to use the corresponding files. But other files have implemented refusal from scratch. The results weren't great though, so this folder is only useful if you are revisiting this topic in the future.

A few files I didn't include:
- `precious_outputs/` (too big, and these outputs didn't work for effective steering)
- `pipeline/` (directly from the repo)
- `dataset/` (directly from the repo)
