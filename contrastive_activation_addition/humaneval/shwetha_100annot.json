A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages .

Serialism is often broadly applied to all music written in what Ralph Northam called `` The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another '' ( Northam 1975 , 218 ; Anon . n.d. ) , or dodecaphony , and methods that evolved from his methods . It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series . In such usages post-Webernian serialism will be used to denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music . Other terms used to make the distinction are twelve - note serialism for the former , and integral serialism for the latter . </P>\nQuestion: who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition",

One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself . From then on , the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second - in - command , but with Kaufman 's planning already in place , the team were able to finish making the film efficiently . </P>\nQuestion: where was the outlaw of josey wales filmed",
