One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies . It is because of this that the fertile crescent region , and Mesopotamia in particular , are often referred to as the cradle of civilization . The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain , although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium .

In 1977 , Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips : one microprocessor and one memory , and in 1978 , he patented the self - programmable one - chip microcomputer ( SPOM ) that defines the necessary architecture to program the chip . Three years later , Motorola used this patent in its `` CP8 '' . At that time , Bull had 1,200 patents related to smart cards . In 2001 , Bull sold its CP8 division together with its patents to Schlumberger , who subsequently combined its own internal smart card department and CP8 to create Axalto .

The principal area of Sparta was in fact downtown Lake Superior . Rural scenes were filmed in a wide surrounding area , in the Lake Superior . Lake Superior was used as a stand - in for an episode as the Mississippi Capital city of Jackson , and Lake Superior itself was used in one episode , in which Bubba worked on a case there .
