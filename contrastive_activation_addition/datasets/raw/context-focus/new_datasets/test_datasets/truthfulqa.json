For largest countries by population, see List of countries and dependencies by population. Dymaxion map of the world with the 30 largest countries and territories by area This is a list of the world's countries and their dependencies by land, water, and total area, ranked by total area. The entries in this list include, but are not limited to, those in the ISO 3166-1 standard, which includes sovereign states and dependent territories. All 193 member states of the United Nations plus the two observer states are given a rank number. Largely unrecognised states not in ISO 3166-1 are included in the list in ranked order. The areas of such largely unrecognised states are in most cases also included in the areas of the more widely recognised states that claim the same territory; see the notes in the \"Notes\" column for each country for clarification. Not included in the list are individual country claims to parts of the continent of Antarctica or entities such as the European Union[a] that have some degree of sovereignty but do not consider themselves to be sovereign countries or dependent territories. This list includes three measurements of area: Total area: the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines. Land area: the aggregate of all land within international boundaries and coastlines, excluding water area. Water area: the sum of the surface areas of all inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) within international boundaries and coastlines. Coastal internal waters may be included. Territorial seas are not included unless otherwise noted. Contiguous zones and exclusive economic zones are not included. Total area is taken from the United Nations Statistics Division unless otherwise noted. Land and water are taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization unless otherwise noted. The CIA World Factbook is most often used when different UN departments disagree. Other sources and details for each entry may be specified in the relevant footnote.

notes ^ The European Union is a unique supranational union. It covers a total area of 4,236,351 km2, and would be ranked 7th if it were included (3.0% of world's total land area). ^ The largest country in the world, which spans two continents, and most of northern Eurasia; with about 1/9th of the world's total landmass. Russia's European portion is roughly 4,000,000 km2, which is around 40% of the total landmass of Europe, making Russia the largest country in Europe; and its Asian portion, which covers all of Northern Asia, is around 13,100,000 km2, making Russia the largest country in Asia. ^ 98% of the land area is covered by ice and snow. The following countries have territorial claims in Antarctica: Argentina (969,000 km2), Australia (5,896,500 km2), Chile (1,250,000 km2), France (432,000 km2), New Zealand (450,000 km2), Norway (including Peter I Island) (2,500,000 km2) and United Kingdom (1,395,000 km2), which to some extent overlap. The area from 90°W to 150°W (2,100,000 km2) is unclaimed territory. These areas normally have no human inhabitants except scientists. ^ Largest country completely in the Western Hemisphere by total area (second-largest by land area after the United States); with the largest surface area of water; largest contiguous country in North America. Total area and water area figures include area covered by freshwater only and do not include internal waters (non-freshwater) of about 1,600,000 km2, nor territorial waters of 200,000 km2. ^ The United Nations Statistics Division, the CIA World Factbook, and the Encyclopædia Britannica all rank the United States ahead of China in total area. However, the figures used by each source include coastal and territorial waters for the United States but exclude coastal and territorial waters for China. China's coastal and territorial water figures are unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure. But Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area excluding coastal and territorial waters as 9,525,067 km2, less than the figure given for China's area by any of the three sources. Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters. ^ Largest country entirely in Asia, and second-largest country in the world by land area. Excludes Taiwan, disputed territories with India, and disputed islands in the South China Sea. Figures for total area and water area also exclude all coastal and territorial waters. ^ Figures are from the U.S. Census and include \"inland\" water and \"Great Lakes\" water, but exclude coastal and territorial water.

Why? ACSH in the Media: From Sea to Shining Sea and Beyond! Given Seattle's solid reputation for rain, it must be one of the wettest cities in America, right? Actually, it's not even close. As it turns out, among the nation's 50 largest cities in terms of precipitation Seattle doesn't even rank in the top half. However, it is tied with Buffalo for the nation's dreariest. How much does it rain in Seattle? It rains enough that a company (based in Seattle, of course) developed a product called a RainGlobe, which is like a snow globe, except it rains inside. (I bought two of them and thought they were pretty cool until the water turned yellow.) Given Seattle's rainy reputation, it must be one of the wettest cities in America, right? Wrong. Not even close. In fact, Seattle doesn't even rank in the top 30 for precipitation among the nation's 50 largest cities. To perform this analysis, I combined data from two sources: (1) Wikipedia's page on the 383 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States; and (2) a website called Current Results that features aggregated weather data. The first chart below depicts the wettest cities ranked by total precipitation: At 37.7 inches of precipitation annually, Seattle ranks 32nd among the nation's 50 largest cities. Notice that most of the cities with more rainfall are located east of the Mississippi River, as shown in the map below made by climatologist Brian Brettschneider. Source: Brian Brettschneider How is it possible that Seattle has such a rainy reputation if it's not even remotely one of the wettest cities in the country? Well, the rain in Seattle is sort of like the mist in the grocery produce aisle. It rarely rains hard; instead, it has a (seemingly) never-ending drizzle that keeps the city wet almost all-year round. (The dry season is the summer, which lasts from roughly July to early October.) So, Seattle's reputation is totally deserved because of the number of days in which it rains. Yet, Seattle only comes in at #5 by this ranking. Believe it or not, there are cities with even more rainy (or snowy) days: Buffalo, Portland, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. Portland didn't surprise me. It's Seattle's \"little brother\" down the road, and the weather there is very similar to ours. But Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh? Really? Apparently, those cities are just about as dreary as Seattle. Climatologist Brian Brettschneider also made what he called the \"Dreariness Index,\" which factors in total precipitation, the number of wet days, and cloudiness. By this metric, Seattle and Buffalo are tied for #1, while Portland and Pittsburgh are tied for #2. Source: Brian Brettschneider Yes, Seattle is a dreary place -- but I like it that way. What can I say? I'm a pluviophile. Tags: rain precipitation weather climate Seattle United States cities Category Other Science News Disqus View the discussion thread.

They write new content and verify and edit content received from contributors. The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica © Andrea Danti/FotoliaAre you a logical, precise thinker, or would you say that you’re more free-spirited and artistic? If you’re the former, somebody’s probably told you at some point that you’re a left-brained person, and if you’re the latter, right-brained. The notion that the right half of the brain is the creative half and the left half is the analytical half and that our individual traits are determined by which half is dominant is widespread in popular psychology. There’s even a small industry devoted to this idea. There are self-help books, personality tests, therapies, and educational materials that claim to help you optimize the functions of the stronger half of your brain, get in touch with the weaker half, or even make the two halves stop their (supposedly) incessant battling inside your skull so you can finally get some peace and quiet.The idea that there are right-brained and left-brained people is a myth. Although we all obviously have different personalities and talents, there’s no reason to believe these differences can be explained by the dominance of one half of the brain over the other half. Recent research using brain imaging technology hasn’t found any evidence of right or left dominance. One of the myth’s fatal flaws is that it relies on vague conceptions of the abilities it purports to explain. Math, for example, requires logical thought and, thus, is generally said to reside in the left brain, far away from all those artsy right-brain abilities. But mathematics is a profoundly creative endeavor in addition to being a logical one. So would a gifted mathematician be a right-brained person or a left-brained person? Likewise, artistic creativity isn’t just unbridled emotion. Many of the greatest works of art are products of rigorous, precise thought.Like many modern myths, the myth of right-brained and left-brained people is rooted in a bit of real science. We know the right and left sides of the brain actually do specialize in different kinds of tasks, although the real division of labor is much more complex than creativity on the right and logic on the left. Much of our knowledge in this area comes from the study of so-called split brain patients. In the 1940s doctors discovered that by surgically severing the corpus callosum (the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) seizures could be reduced in patients with otherwise unmanageable epilepsy. (The procedure is seldom performed today because new drugs and treatments have been developed.) After the operation, the patients had normal intellectual and emotional functioning and seemed to have only mild impairments. More thorough examinations, though, revealed specific disruptions in perception and cognition that illuminated how the two halves of the brain differ from each other and how they cooperate. Generally, the right hemisphere of the brain was found to be more proficient at spatial tasks, while the left side of the brain was found to be the center of language and problem-solving.If there’s no evidence for the myth of right-brained and left-brained people, why do so many people believe it? Perhaps it just makes intuitive sense that people’s brains would be dominant on one side or the other just as their hands, feet, or eyes are. It may also have something to do with our seemingly unlimited appetite for schemes that allow us to sort ourselves (and our friends) into “types” based on our emotional and intellectual characteristics. Most of these (the Myers-Briggs personality test, for example) have about as much scientific validity as horoscopes, but they exploit a psychological phenomenon known as the Barnum Effect (or sometimes the Forer Effect): When people are offered generic descriptive statements that are presented as individualized descriptions of their own personalities, they are predisposed to accept them as meaningful and true, especially if the statements are positive. (The psychologists who studied this phenomenon gave out fake personality tests and found that people generally rated the bogus feedback as accurate.) The right-brain/left-brain myth works in a similar way. The “insights” that it generates are both generic and flattering. After all, who would reject a description of themselves as “spontaneous and intuitive” or “rational and analytical”? The myth is popular, in the end, because it gives us a “scientific” way to talk about our favorite subject—ourselves. Load More",

One of the reasons Japan developed the blood type personality indicator theory was in reaction to a claim from German scientist Emil von Dungern, that Blood type B people were inferior. The popular belief originates with publications by Masahiko Nomi in the 1970s. Although some medical hypotheses have been proposed in support of blood type personality theory, the scientific community generally dismisses blood type personality theories as superstition or pseudoscience because of lack of evidence or testable criteria. Although research into the causal link between blood type and personality is limited, the majority of modern studies do not demonstrate any statistically significant association between the two. Some studies suggest that there is a statistically significant relationship between blood type and personality, although it is unclear if this is simply due to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Overview[edit] According to popular belief, people with type A blood are friendly and kind, people with type B are spontaneous and creative, and people with type O are confident and aggressive. In a logical extension of this system, those with type AB are a mix of stereotypical A and B traits. History[edit] Machine offering blood-type based fortunes The idea that personality traits were inherited through the blood dates as far back as Aristotle. Hippocrates also sought to link personality biologically, linking traits with the four bodily humors – sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. In 1926, Rin Hirano and Tomita Yashima published the article \"Blood Type Biological Related\" in the Army Medical Journal. Takeji Furukawa[edit] In 1927, Takeji Furukawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's Teacher's School, published his paper \"The Study of Temperament Through Blood Type\" in the scholarly journal Psychological Research. The idea quickly took off with the Japanese public despite Furukawa's lack of credentials, and the militarist government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding ideal soldiers. The study used ten to twenty people for the investigation, thereby failing to meet the statistical requirements for generalizing the results to the wider population.[citation needed] On the other hand, in 1934, Fisher announced the chi-squared test, which is very popular at present, for the first time. Several scholars said that they found statistically significant differences in analyzing Japanese work conducted at that time. In another study, Furukawa compared the distribution of blood types among two ethnic groups: the Formosans in Taiwan and the Ainu of Hokkaidō. His motivation for the study appears to have come from a political incident: After the Japanese occupation of Taiwan following Japan's invasion of China in 1895, the inhabitants tenaciously resisted their occupiers. Insurgencies in 1930 and 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers. The purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% is type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood. Masahiko Nomi[edit] Main article: Masahiko Nomi Interest in the theory was revived in the 1970s with a book by Masahiko Nomi, a journalist with no medical background (he graduated from the engineering department of the University of Tokyo). Few Japanese psychologists criticized him at that time, so he continued to demonstrate statistically significant data in various fields and published several books with these results. Later after his death in 1981, Masahiko Nomi's work was said to be largely uncontrolled and anecdotal, and the methodology of his conclusions was unclear. Because of this, he was heavily criticized by the Japanese psychological community, although his books remain popular. His son, Toshitaka Nomi, continued to promote the theory with a series of books and by running the Institute of Blood Type Humanics. He later established the Human Science ABO Center for further research and publication in 2004.

His statistical analysis found that less than 0.3% of the total variance in personality was explained by blood type. Controversial statistically significant data[edit] However, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988. These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes influenced their self-reported personalities – like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Cosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011. They demonstrated that significant and the same difference in personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, the difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, the difference was statistically significant, too. However, the effect magnitude was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense. Another Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects) and 2006 (1,362 subjects), In both cases, the subjects were university students, and only subjects with enough knowledge of and belief in the \"blood-type diagnosis\" showed meaningful differences. He concluded that these differences must be the influence of mass media, especially TV programs. Yamaoka later examined 6,660 samples from 1999 through 2009 in total and found the same result. On the other hand, some[who?] believe that the statistically meaningful differences according to the blood types are not explained only by beliefs, nor that they are a self-fulfilling prophecy. In Japan, the penetration rate[definition needed] of blood-typical personality traits was investigated. Yoriko Watanabe, a psychologist at Hokkaido University, chose \"well-known\" traits and found most traits were known to no more than half of Japanese people (subjects were university students). A Japanese writer, Masayuki Kanazawa, analyzed these blood-typical traits in combination with data from Yamaoka (1999) that used the same items from Watanabe's penetration survey. If blood-typical differences are caused by penetration (or their self-recognition), the rate of differences of a trait is proportional to the rate of its penetration.[clarification needed] However, Kanazawa was not able to discover any association with blood-type differences and penetration rates. This result raises doubt[among whom?] about the role of beliefs and self-fulfilling prophecy.[scientific citation needed] Most reports that demonstrated statistical correlation attribute differences to a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, no study directly proved the existence of \"self-fulfillment\". Therefore, the opinions of researchers are varied at present[citation needed]: Whether there is a statistical correlation or not; Whether any statistical correlations are superficial, being caused by subjects' self-fulfilling prophecy, or if they are truly caused by the blood type. In a 2021 Japanese study, ANOVA results of a 6,000-population large-scale survey showed that respondents displayed the personality traits corresponding to their own blood type more strongly than respondents who had different blood types did. This finding was consistent across all traits, and all differences were statistically significant. The same differences in scores were found in the groups who reported no blood type personality knowledge, although the values were smaller. Blood-type personality and the five-factor model[edit] The five-factor model tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the \"big five\" personality traits. It was expected that differences in self-reported personalities (a self-fulfilling prophecy) would be detected from the subject who believed in blood-typical stereotypes. As a result, researchers found no meaningful statistical difference. So Ho Cho, a Korean psychologist (Yonsei University), and the others carried out a questionnaire about blood-typical items to subjects and discovered statistical differences as expected. However, the difference was not found when the five-factor model for big five personality traits was administered to the same subjects. Another Korean researcher Sohn (Yonsei University) re-analyzed Cho's data. He found that several independent items of the big five personality test detected differences according to each blood-typical stereotype. However, these differences became extinct in the process of plural items being gathered to five factors (big five). If these results are correct, the five-factor model test cannot detect differences between the blood types – if such a causal link did indeed exist. In 2014, a Korean matchmaking company 듀오 Duo conducted a research survey examined 3,000 couples and found that blood type had no significant impact on the possibility of a couple getting married. In 2017, a meta-analysis of studies, using the Big Five personality test, involving 260,861 subjects found that six genes affected human personality. However, the coefficient of determination was as low as 0.04%. This is usually considered to be an error. Studies of blood distribution in various fields[edit] In order to avoid the influence of \"contamination by knowledge\", a Japanese psychologist group published a series of studies, but no significant differences were found except for Japanese prime ministers. Later, it was reported that significant differences were found not only for prime ministers, but also for foreign ministers, education ministers, professional baseball hitters, and soccer players in Japan. Brain waves and light topography[edit] Kim and Yi (Seoul University of Venture & Information) measured the brain waves of 4,636 adults. They reported that type O people were most stress-resistant. Popularity[edit] In Japan, discussion of blood types is widely popular in women's magazines as a way of gauging relationship compatibility with a potential or current partner. Morning television shows feature blood type horoscopes, and similar horoscopes are published daily in newspapers. The blood types of celebrities are listed in their infoboxes on Japanese Wikipedia. A series of four books that describe people's character by blood type ranked third, fourth, fifth, and ninth on a list of best-selling books in Japan in 2008 compiled by Tohan Corporation. No less than two-thirds of the respondents, hailing from Chinese speaking East Asian countries and areas, believe in the association between blood types and personality. Furthermore, according to one Japanese survey, more than half of the Japanese respondents are fond of talking about blood type and personality. The research also says that people in Japan like blood-typical personality diagnosis and 1. talk about it with proper knowledge, 2. believe some relationships exist between blood type and personality, 3. feel its traits apply to themselves to a certain degree. The results of the two other surveys are the same. Although there is no proven correlation between blood type and personality, it remains popular with the many matchmaking services that cater to blood type. In this way, it is similar to the use of astrological signs, which are also popular in Japan. Asking one's blood type is common in Japan, and people are often surprised when a non-Japanese does not know their blood type. It is common among anime and manga authors to mention their characters' blood types and to give their characters blood types to match their personalities. Some video game characters have known blood types. Also, it is common for video game series to allow for blood type as an option in their creation modes. After then-Reconstruction Minister Ryu Matsumoto's abrasive comments towards the governors of Iwate and Miyagi forced him to step down from his post, he partially blamed his behavior on his blood type, saying \"My blood is type B, which means I can be irritable and impetuous, and my intentions don't always come across.\" Blood types are important in South Korea as well. The Korean webcomic A Simple Thinking About Blood Type depicts the stereotypes of each blood type and has been adapted as a short anime series in Japan as Ketsuekigata-kun! in 2013 and 2015. Discrimination[edit] Blood type harassment, called bura-hara (wasei-eigo: a portmanteau of blood and harassment), has been blamed for bullying of children in playgrounds, loss of job opportunities, and ending of happy relationships. Many people in Japan and Korea have been discriminated against because of their blood type. Employers ask blood types during interviews despite the warnings they have been given. Children at schools have been split up according to their blood type. The national softball team has customized training to fit each player's blood type. Companies have given work assignments according to their employee's blood type. However, these episodes are thought to be more or less exaggerated – as well as horoscope addiction in Europe or the US, which is sometimes reported in Japan. No blood-type harassment trials have been reported, so far. In reality, most Japanese people do not think blood types determine their personalities, but rather affect them to some degree.

But in recent years there have been many exciting scientific discoveries, some aided by new imaging techniques--which allow us for the first time to watch the living mind at work--and others by ingenious experiments conducted by researchers all over the world. There are still perplexing mysteries--how, for instance, do idiot savants perform almost miraculous mathematical feats?--but the picture is growing steadily clearer. In The Number Sense, Stanislas Dehaene offers general readers a first look at these recent stunning discoveries, in an enlightening exploration of the mathematical mind. Dehaene, a mathematician turned cognitive neuropsychologist, begins with the eye-opening discovery that animals--including rats, pigeons, raccoons, and chimpanzees--can perform simple mathematical calculations, and he describes ingenious experiments that show that human infants also have a rudimentary number sense (American scientist Karen Wynn, for instance, using just a few Mickey Mouse toys and a small puppet theater, proved that five-month-old infants already have the ability to add and subtract). Further, Dehaene suggests that this rudimentary number sense is as basic to the way the brain understands the world as our perception of color or of objects in space, and, like these other abilities, our number sense is wired into the brain. But how then did the brain leap from this basic number ability to trigonometry, calculus, and beyond? Dehaene shows that it was the invention of symbolic systems of numerals that started us on the climb to higher mathematics, and in a marvelous chapter he traces the history of numbers, from early times when people indicated a number by pointing to a part of their body (even today, in many societies in New Guinea, the word for six is \"wrist\"), to early abstract numbers such as Roman numerals (chosen for the ease with which they could be carved into wooden sticks), to modern numbers. On our way, we also discover many fascinating facts: for example, because Chinese names for numbers are so short, Chinese people can remember up to nine or ten digits at a time--English-speaking people can only remember seven. Dehaene also explores the unique abilities of idiot savants and mathematical geniuses, asking what might explain their special mathematical talent. And we meet people whose minute brain lesions render their mathematical ability useless--one man, in fact, who is certain that two and two is three. Using modern imaging techniques (PET scans and MRI), Dehaene reveals exactly where in the brain numerical calculation takes place. But perhaps most important, The Number Sense reaches many provocative conclusions that will intrigue anyone interested in mathematics or the mind. Dehaene argues, for instance, that many of the difficulties that children face when learning math, and which may turn into a full-blown adult \"innumeracy,\" stem from the architecture of our primate brain, which has not evolved for the purpose of doing mathematics. He also shows why the human brain does not work like a computer, and that the physical world is not based on mathematics--rather, mathematics evolved to explain the physical world the way that the eye evolved to provide sight. A truly fascinating look at the crossroads where numbers and neurons intersect, The Number Sense offers an intriguing tour of how the structure of the brain shapes our mathematical abilities, and how our mathematics opens up a window on the human mind.

Search Search | en enfr News News Topic: Experiments Voir en français Highlights from CERN in 2012 A Higgs-like boson, more new particles and record performance at the LHC: 2012 has been good to CERN 21 December, 2012 | By Cian O'Luanaigh A candidate event in the search for the Higgs boson, showing two electrons and two muons (Image: CMS/CERN) It's been an important year for physics at CERN. \"[This year] will go down in history as marking the first of the LHC's major discoveries, a defining moment in the history of science,\" says Director-General Rolf Heuer in his end-of-year message to CERN people. On 4 July the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced that they had both observed a new particle, consistent with the long-sought Higgs boson. \"Though we don't yet know the full details of the particle announced in July, it is looking more and more like the Higgs boson first proposed in 1964,\" says Heuer. The discovery was made possible by the excellent performance of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which broke several performance records this year. In April the LHC experiments started taking data at the new collision energy of 8 TeV (up from 7 TeV in 2011) and the collider delivered a record number of collisions to the experiments this year. The LHC collided protons with lead ions for the first time in a test run for further lead-proton collisions in 2013, and rounded off the year in style with a new performance milestone, nearly doubling the number of proton bunches in the machine, just as the three-year proton run came to an end. The LHCb experiment discovered two excited states for the Λb beauty particle, and measured of one of the rarest processes so far observed in particle physics, the decay of a Bs (pronounced B-sub-s) meson into two muons. ALICE performed detailed studies of the quark-gluon plasma, the matter of the primordial universe, and measurements from the TOTEM experiment are giving insights on the structure of the proton and provide input to the analyses of the other LHC experiments. Also this year, CERN signed a contract with the Wigner Research Centre for Physics in Budapest, Hungary, to extend the capabilities of the CERN Data Centre; there were exciting results from the antimatter hall as ALPHA made the first spectroscopic measurements of antihydrogen; and CERN celebrated several anniversaries: the Proton Synchrotron Booster celebrated its 40th birthday and to mark 100 years of research in cosmic rays the laboratory welcomed the astronauts who placed the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station. Although the LHC will not be running after February 2013, CERN certainly will. The whole accelerator chain will undergo maintenance, ready for running at a higher energy in 2015. Projects such as the Compact Linear Collider and High Luminosity LHC are already working on next-generation technology for future accelerators and detectors. 2013 is sure to be a busy year for CERN.

Rating: False About this rating A widely shared video on TikTok posted by user Ashley Sheehan (@thedopestginger) on March 31, 2021, claimed that “five years ago” she had an emergency hysterectomy. But in 2021, Sheehan continued — despite having a portion of her uterus removed — she began experiencing a period and was subsequently told by a doctor that she had a “full-grown uterus.” “Did I regrow it? Did I have two? Was it never removed? I don’t know,” said Sheehan in the video, which had been liked more than 65,000 times as of this writing. In three follow-up videos, Sheehan said that she had a partial hysterectomy when she was 14 years old and pregnant with her first child. At 27 weeks, she had what is known as placental abruption, a serious complication where the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus that can decrease or block the baby’s supply of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother. After Sheehan experienced heavy bleeding, doctors conducted an emergency Caesarean and a partial hysterectomy, which removes part of the uterus and leaves the cervix intact, to stop the bleeding. In an April 1, 2021, video, Sheehan said she received a second opinion and an ultrasound and was told that her uterus looks “fine.” Sheehan also said that she retained all of her medical records, but she did not respond to Snopes’ attempt to verify the information. U.S. Office on Women's Health A hysterectomy is a surgery to either entirely or partially remove a biological woman’s uterus for a number of possible reasons, including uterine fibroids, endometriosis, or cancer, according to the U.S. Office on Women’s Health. While the National Institute of General Medical Sciences notes regeneration is possible for humans inasmuch as we can regrow lost tissues and cells, there is no evidence to suggest that a fully removed uterus can regrow. Regeneration occurs when skin scars or hair regrows, or even when a bone fracture is healed when new tissue is grown. Even the liver experiences regeneration to an extent in what is known as compensatory hypertrophy. When part of the liver is removed or destroyed, the remaining portion has been known to grow to its original size and allow the organ to function as it did before. Kidneys, the pancreas, the thyroid, adrenal glands and lungs can also compensate for organ loss, but in a much more limited way. But a uterus is not one of those organs — and humans do not have the ability to regrow organs when one has been completely removed. One explanation in Sheehan's case (as she herself suggested in her first video) could be that she initially had a double uterus, a rare congenital abnormality that the Mayo Clinic notes often results in successful pregnancies, but can increase the risk of miscarriage or premature birth. “In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the fetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ — the uterus,” wrote the medical nonprofit. “Sometimes, however, the tubes don’t join completely. Instead, each one develops into a separate structure.” According to an interview with Robert Zurawin, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, conducted by Scientific American in 2009, about one in 2,000 women will experience a double uterus. That being said, it is important to note that it is possible to get pregnant after a hysterectomy — and that doesn’t necessarily mean that the uterus has grown back. In one case study published in the Journal of Medical Case Reports, the researchers describe a 32-year-old African woman who experienced what is known as an ectopic pregnancy. If a person has ovaries making eggs, a fertilized egg can implant in the ovaries. In this particular case, the woman had her uterus removed six years prior via hysterectomy after a Caesarean. “While a complete uterus is the typical site of gestation, it is not absolutely necessary for fertilization and implantation,” wrote the study authors at the time. “Pregnancy following hysterectomy is very rare and may lead to significant morbidity, especially when diagnosis is delayed.” It is also possible to still experience a menstrual cycle following a hysterectomy. Another case study published in the Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences described what is known as endometriosis, a painful condition when the inner lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) can implant anywhere in the abdomen. Hormones trigger the endometrium to grow like a normal menstrual cycle, causing the lining to build up and then shed. In an update posted to TikTok on April 23, Sheehan shared “good news” that everything was “super normal” and she did not, in fact, have two uteruses. “I do not have two uteruses. Basically, when you think of a hysterectomy, you think that they’ve removed a uterus but in my case, they took a super, super small piece very close to the cervix and took that out,” she said. “Visually and atomically, I do have a uterus. I cannot carry children any longer and I won’t be able to get pregnant.” Because our investigation did not reveal any documented cases and Sheehan confirmed in an April 23 follow-up video that she did have a uterus, we rate this claim as “False.” Updates [May 6, 2021]: This article was updated to include recent medical findings from Sheehan’s doctor.

WeemsOccupation(s)Book agent and authorNotable workThe Life of WashingtonSignature Mason Locke Weems (October 11, 1759 – May 23, 1825), usually referred to as Parson Weems, was an American minister, evangelical bookseller and author who wrote (and rewrote and republished) the first biography of George Washington immediately after his death. Some popular stories about Washington thought during the 20th century to be apocryphal can be traced to Weems, including the cherry tree tale (\"I cannot tell a lie, I did it with my little hatchet\"). Weems' biography of Washington was a bestseller that depicted Washington's virtues and was intended to provide morally instructive tales for the youth of the young nation. Early life[edit] Mason Weems was born on October 11, 1759, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, the youngest of nineteen children. His family traced their ancestry to Scotland. When he was ten years old, his parents sent him away to study at the Kent County Free School in Chestertown, Maryland (which later became Washington College). During the 1770s, Weems studied medicine in Edinburgh, then in the 1780s after a religious conversion, Weems studied theology in London. Minister and traveling bookseller[edit] Bel Air Plantation, where Weems and his family moved upon the death of his father-in-law, Col. Jesse Ewell, in 1805 Returning to the new United States, and with the help of John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, Weems was ordained in the Episcopal Church. In 1784, he became the rector All Hallows Parish, in his native Anne Arundel County, and also served as chaplain of a school for girls, and preached to local African Americans. He soon began disseminating prayer books, as well as established a charitable society to relieve widows and orphans. However, his tendencies toward Methodism (whose ministers were itinerant) proved unpopular with his bishop, Thomas John Claggett, so by 1792 Weems resigned as rector and began a traveling ministry, which included selling books on behalf of Mathew Carey, a prominent Philadelphia publisher who had emigrated from Ireland to flee persecution based on his Catholic faith. In 1795 Weems married Frances Ewell, the daughter of prominent local patriot and planter Jesse Ewell (1734-1805) and established a household in Dumfries, Virginia. He had a small bookstore in Dumfries that now houses the Weems–Botts Museum, but continued to travel extensively, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic states and South, a market previously dominated by British booksellers, selling books and preaching. Dumfries is not far from Pohick Church, part of Truro Parish, in Lorton, Virginia, where both George Washington and his father Augustine had worshiped in pre-Revolutionary days. Weems occasionally preached at Pohick Church, but later inflated this Washington connection and promoted himself as the former \"rector of Mount-Vernon parish\". In fact, Washington had provided an invaluable endorsement to what would be Weems's first bestselling pamphlet, condemning partisanship shortly before the former President's death, The Philanthropist: or a Good Twenty-Five Cents Worth of Political Love Powder, for Honest Adamites and Jeffersonists. In 1792 and 1793, Weems received Washington's endorsement of his first publishing venture, a two-volume edition of sermons by Hugh Blair, and would receive other endorsements from later presidents, as well as prominent local figures. Furthermore, Weems learned from his interaction with bishop Claggett. When Virginia's evangelically-oriented bishop William Meade complained about Weems selling works by confirmed atheist Thomas Paine, Weems responded that he would only sell it together with Richard Watson's reply, An Apology for the Bible. In 1800 he published A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington, a popular book in its time that went into many reprints. Other notable works by Weems include Life of General Francis Marion (1805); Life of Benjamin Franklin, with Essays (1817); and Life of William Penn (1819). Weems also wrote several morality pamphlets, including God's Revenge Against Gambling, Against Duelling, and The Drunkard's Looking Glass. Not long after his father-in-law died in 1805, Weems began managing the Ewell family estate, and by 1808 moved his family within Prince William County to the Ewell family mansion, Bel Air. However, he had debts, so in 1808 sold Carey the copyright to his biography of George Washington for $1000, a sale which he soon regretted. In 1830, Weems owned two slaves, a young man and woman both between 10 and 24 years old. Although Weems continued to travel extensively, Bel Air became his base, where his wife and family lived. He was an accomplished violinist,[citation needed] and took the instrument with him on his trips. While traveling in Beaufort, South Carolina, Weems died on May 23, 1825, of unspecified causes. He is buried at Bel Air. Influence and historical reliability[edit] The New York Times has described Weems as one of the \"early hagiographers\" of American literature \"who elevated the Swamp Fox, Francis Marion, into the American pantheon and helped secure a place there for George Washington\". Weems's name would probably be forgotten today were it not for the tension between the liveliness of his narratives and what Appletons' Cyclopaedia of American Biography (1889) called \"this charge of a want of veracity [that] is brought against all Weems's writings,\" adding that \"it is probable he would have accounted it excusable to tell any good story to the credit of his heroes.\" The cherry-tree anecdote illustrates this point. Another dubious anecdote found in Weems's biography is that of Washington's prayer during the winter at Valley Forge. According to the historian James M. McPherson, Weems's biography of George Washington was likely Abraham Lincoln's only exposure to the study of history as a boy. In a lecture given on Lincoln's birthday in 2010 at Washington and Lee University, McPherson explained how Lincoln, as president-elect, had spoken to the Legislature at Trenton, New Jersey near where, on the day after Christmas 1776, the American Revolution had been saved from collapse by Washington's ragged troops. According to McPherson, Lincoln said: \"I remember all the accounts in Weems's books of the battlefields and struggles for the liberty of the country and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton: the crossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time-- all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single revolutionary event. I recollect thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have been something more than common that those men struggled for.\" Weems's book Life of George Washington (1800) is an early source that helped popularize the phrase \"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!\", said to have come from the Battle of Bunker Hill. According to modern scholarly consensus, it was never said at the battle and originated elsewhere. Exaltation of Washington[edit] The exalted esteem in which the Founding Fathers of the United States, especially George Washington, were held by 19th-century Americans may seem absurd today, but that Washington was so regarded is undisputed. The strength of this esteem can be seen on the ceiling of the United States Capitol Building in the form of Constantino Brumidi's fresco The Apotheosis of Washington. Weems's A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington, was a biography written in this spirit, amplified by the florid, rollicksome style that was Weems's trademark. According to this account, his subject was \"... Washington, the hero, and the Demigod ...\" and at a level above that \"... what he really was, [was] 'the Jupiter Conservator,' the friend and benefactor of men.\" With this hyperbole, Weems elevated Washington to the Augustan level of the god \"Jupiter Conservator [Orbis]\" (that is, \"Jupiter, Conservator of the Empire\", later rendered \"Jupiter, Savior of the World\"). Cherry-tree anecdote[edit] Parson Weems' Fable, a 1939 painting by Grant Wood, depicting both Weems and his \"Cherry Tree\" story Among the exaggerated or invented anecdotes is that of the cherry tree, attributed by Weems to \"... an aged lady, who was a distant relative, and, when a girl, spent much of her time in the family ...\" who referred to young George as \"cousin\". The following anecdote is a case in point. It is too valuable to be lost, and too true to be doubted; for it was communicated to me by the same excellent lady to whom I am indebted for the last. \"When George,\" said she, \"was about six years old, he was made the wealthy master of a hatchet! Of which, like most little boys, he was immoderately fond, and was constantly going about chopping everything that came in his way. One day, in the garden, where he often amused himself hacking his mother's pea-sticks, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet on the body of a beautiful young English cherry-tree, which he barked so terribly, that I don't believe the tree ever got the better of it. The next morning the old gentleman, finding out what had befallen his tree, which, by the by, was a great favourite, came into the house; and with much warmth asked for the mischievous author, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for his tree. Nobody could tell him anything about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. \"George,\" said his father, \"do you know who killed that beautiful little cherry tree yonder in the garden?\" This was a tough question; and George staggered under it for a moment; but quickly recovered himself: and looking at his father, with the sweet face of youth brightened with the inexpressible charm of all-conquering truth, he bravely cried out, \"I can't tell a lie, Pa; you know I can't tell a lie. I did cut it with my hatchet.\" \"Run to my arms, you dearest boy,\" cried his father in transports, \"run to my arms; glad am I, George, that you killed my tree; for you have paid me for it a thousand fold. Such an act of heroism in my son is more worth than a thousand trees, though blossomed with silver, and their fruits of purest gold.\" It went on to be reprinted in the popular McGuffey Reader used by schoolchildren, making it part of American culture, causing Washington's February 22 birthday to be celebrated with cherry dishes, with the cherry often claimed to be a favorite of his. As early as 1889, in Henry Cabot Lodge's biography of Washington, historians have acknowledged that while there was \"nothing intrinsically impossible\" about the story, it and other stories recounted by Weems were \"on their face hopelessly and ridiculously false.\" Cultural references[edit] In 1911 Lawrence C. Wroth published Parson Weems: A Biographical and Critical Study. In this he confronts the fact that Weems is best known for the story of the cherry tree (p. 6) and examines the evidence for its likelihood (pp. 65ff). Grant Wood painted the scene under the title \"Parson Weems' Fable\" in 1939. It is among his gently ironic depictions of Americana and shows the parson pulling back a curtain rimmed with cherries to show the story. Notes[edit] ^ Furstenberg, Francois (2006).

                        "Some popular stories about Washington thought during the 20th century to be apocryphal can be traced to Weems, including the cherry tree tale (\"I cannot tell a lie, I did it with my little hatchet\")",

Cryptozoology is a pseudoscience, which primarily looks at anecdotal stories, and other claims rejected by the scientific community. While biologists regularly identify new species following established scientific methodology, cryptozoologists focus on entities mentioned in the folklore record and rumor. Entities that may be considered cryptids by cryptozoologists include Bigfoot, Yeti, the chupacabra, the Jersey Devil, the Loch Ness Monster, and the Mokele-mbembe. Scholars have noted that the cryptozoology subculture rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence (including the pseudoscience's association with Young Earth creationism), noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as ghost hunting and ufology, and highlighted uncritical media propagation of cryptozoologist claims.

Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing has found no evidence to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified.: 424 The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance. Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity,: 85 and is thus regarded as pseudoscience.: 1350 There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth in the way astrologers say they do that does not contradict well-understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.: 249 Modern scientific inquiry into astrology is primarily focused on drawing a correlation between astrological traditions and the influence of seasonal birth in humans. Introduction[edit] The majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology-based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the remunerator's future.: 83 Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so \"in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary\". Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief, saying that \"part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you\". The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as a demonstration of low scientific literacy, although some continue to believe in it even though they are scientifically literate. Historical relationship with astronomy[edit] Main article: Astrology and astronomy The foundations of the theoretical structure used in astrology originate with the Babylonians, although widespread usage did not occur until the start of the Hellenistic period after Alexander the Great swept through Greece. It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is is cultural and varied between civilisations.: 62 Ptolemy's work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the planetary movements.: 40 Early Western astrology operated under the Ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm, and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy.: 73 While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.: 344 During the Islamic Golden Age, astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters, such as the eccentricity of the sun's orbit, required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to sufficient accuracy and precision. Those in positions of power, like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120, funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions, fuelled by precise planetary information, could be made.: 55–56 Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions, few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam, and most were torn down during or just after construction.: 57 The clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679, with the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps.: 220 Unlike the West, in Iran, the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century, in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran.: 10 The first work, Falak al-sa'ada by Ictizad al-Saltana, aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and \"old astronomy\" in Iran was published in 1861. On astrology, it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible.: 17–18 Philosophy of science[edit] Philosopher Karl Popper proposed falsifiability as ideas that distinguish science from non-science, using astrology as the example of an idea that has not dealt with falsification during experiment. Astrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests.: 62 Falsifiability[edit] Science and non-science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability. The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper. To Popper, science does not rely on induction; instead, scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests. If a single test fails, then the theory is falsified.: 10 Therefore, any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory, and expect other specific results consistent with the theory. Using this criterion of falsifiability, astrology is a pseudoscience. Astrology was Popper's most frequent example of pseudoscience.: 7 Popper regarded astrology as \"pseudo-empirical\" in that \"it appeals to observation and experiment\", but \"nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards\".: 44 In contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines, this is a hallmark of pseudoscience.: 206 \"No puzzles to solve\"[edit] In contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.: 401 To Kuhn, although astrologers had, historically, made predictions that \"categorically failed\", this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult (through subsuming, after the fact, a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction). Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research,: 8 and so, \"They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise.\": 8 : 401 While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.: 8 Progress, practice and consistency[edit] Philosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative.: 228 To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be \"selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations\".: 227–228 Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years.: 228 : 549 To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the \"many unsolved problems\", and in the face of better alternative theories (Psychology). For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience.: 228 To Thagard, astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone's career, twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies, lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy's time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time.: 226–227 Rather, his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci: \"theory, community [and] historical context\". While verification and falsifiability focused on the theory, Kuhn's work focused on the historical context, but the astrological community should also be considered. Whether or not they:: 226–227 are focused on comparing their approach to others. have a consistent approach. try to falsify their theory through experiment. In this approach, true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed.: 228 Irrationality[edit] For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.: 34 What if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence, blatant insensitivity to evidence, no sense of a hierarchy of reasons, slight command over the contextual force of critieria, stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads, stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on? In that case, I think, we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational. ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning.— Edward W. James: 34 This poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning, and vague claims. The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly \"the same place have a life pattern that is very similar\" is vague, but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of \"same place\" despite the planet's moving in the reference frame of the Solar System. Other comments by astrologers are based on severely erroneous interpretations of basic physics, such as the general belief by medieval astrologers that the geocentric Solar System corresponded to an atom. Further, James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic, an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology, but any differences are due to \"heredity and environment\", while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology.: 32 Further, to astrologers, if something appears in their favour, they may latch upon it as proof, while making no attempt to explore its implications, preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored.: 33 Quinean dichotomy[edit] From the Quinean web of knowledge, there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology.: 24 Tests of astrology[edit] Astrologers often avoid making verifiable predictions, and instead rely on vague statements that let them try to avoid falsification.: 48–49 Across several centuries of testing, the predictions of astrology have never been more accurate than that expected by chance alone. One approach used in testing astrology quantitatively is through blind experiment. When specific predictions from astrologers were tested in rigorous experimental procedures in the Carlson test, the predictions were falsified. All controlled experiments have failed to show any effect.: 24 Mars effect[edit] Main article: Mars effect The initial Mars effect finding, showing the relative frequency of the diurnal position of Mars in the birth charts (N = 570) of \"eminent athletes\" (red solid line) compared to the expected results [after Michel Gauquelin 1955] In 1955, astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in professions (such as doctors, scientists, athletes, actors, writers, painters, etc.), which astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the \"Mars effect\".: 213 A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence.: 213–214 They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study. Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations,[a] where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.: 116 Carlson's experiment[edit] Shawn Carlson's now renowned experiment was performed by 28 astrologers matching over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) test using double blind methods. The experimental protocol used in Carlson's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment. Astrologers, nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, acted as the astrological advisors, and helped to ensure, and agreed, that the test was fair.: 117 : 420 They also chose 26 of the 28 astrologers for the tests, the other two being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards.: 420 The astrologers came from Europe and the United States.: 117 The astrologers helped to draw up the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested.: 419 Published in Nature in 1985, the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing \"clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis\". Dean and Kelly[edit] Scientist and former astrologer Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large-scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology. A further test involved 45 confident[b] astrologers, with an average of 10 years' experience and 160 test subjects (out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to extremes.: 191 The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals' ages, and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all.[c]: 191 Other tests[edit] A meta-analysis was conducted, pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart.: 190 In 10 studies, participants picked horoscopes that they felt were accurate descriptions, with one being the \"correct\" answer. Again the results were no better than chance.: 66–67 In a study of 2011 sets of people born within 5 minutes of each other (\"time twins\") to see if there was any discernible effect; no effect was seen.: 67 Quantitative sociologist David Voas examined the census data for more than 20 million individuals in England and Wales to see if star signs corresponded to marriage arrangements. No effect was seen.: 67 Theoretic obstacles[edit] Beyond the scientific tests astrology has failed, proposals for astrology face a number of other obstacles due to the many theoretical flaws in astrology: 62 : 24 including lack of consistency, lack of ability to predict missing planets, lack of connection of the zodiac to the constellations in Western astrology, and lack of any plausible mechanism. The underpinnings of astrology tend to disagree with numerous basic facts from scientific disciplines.: 24 Lack of consistency[edit] Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict.: 83 Dean and Kelly documented 25 studies, which had found that the degree of agreement amongst astrologers' predictions was measured as a low 0.1.[d]: 66 Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.: 83 Georges Charpak and Henri Broch dealt with claims from Western astrology in the book Debunked! ESP, Telekinesis, and other Pseudoscience. They pointed out that astrologers have only a small knowledge of astronomy and that they often do not take into account basic features such as the precession of the equinoxes. They commented on the example of Elizabeth Teissier who claimed that \"the sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year\" as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday but a number of years apart should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that \"there is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years\" and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.: 6–7 Lack of physical basis[edit] Edward W. James, commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factors—namely, that astrologers did not want to wake up early, and the exact time of noon was hard to know. Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.: 25 This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.: 26 Philosopher of science, Massimo Pigliucci commenting on the movement, opined \"Well then, which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper, I wonder?\": 64 The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they do not reference them. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being \"...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars.\" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius. Lack of predictive power[edit] Shown in the image is Pluto and its satellites. Astrology was claimed to work before the discovery of Neptune, Uranus and Pluto and they have now been included in the discourse on an ad hoc basis. Some astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account, but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes. Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton's law of universal gravitation. The grafting on of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis. On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet, Philip Zarka of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France wondered how astrologers should respond: Should astrologers remove it from the list of luminars [Sun, Moon and the 8 planets other than earth] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement? If they decide to keep it, what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies (Sedna, Quaoar. etc), some of which even have satellites (Xena, 2003EL61)? Lack of mechanism[edit] Astrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour. In a lecture in 2001, Stephen Hawking stated \"The reason most scientists don't believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment.\" In 1975, amid increasing popular interest in astrology, The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok, Lawrence E. Jerome, and Paul Kurtz. The statement, entitled \"Objections to Astrology\", was signed by 186 astronomers, physicists and leading scientists of the day. They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question. Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur: We can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars. It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures. Astronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement. Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity, but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian, and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism (while \"certainly a relevant point\") was not in itself convincing. In a letter published in a follow-up edition of The Humanist, Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief. This, he argued, would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy. The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm, \"as above so below\" to decide meaning such as Edward W. James' example of \"Mars above is red, so Mars below means blood and war\", is a false cause fallacy.: 26 Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific. If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.: 65 Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. The strength of these forces drops off with distance.: 65 Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the Sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn't based just off the Sun alone.: 65 While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.: 65 It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance.: 65 If distance is irrelevant, then, logically, all objects in space should be taken into account.: 66 Carl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity, the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection, to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted. However, synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable. The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non-random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology.[e] Psychology[edit] See also: Forer effect Psychological studies have not found any robust relationship between astrological signs and life outcomes. For example, a study showed that zodiac signs are no more effective than random numbers in predicting subjective well-being and quality of life. It has also been shown that confirmation bias is a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology.: 344 : 180–181 : 42–48 Confirmation bias is a form of cognitive bias.[f]: 553 From the literature, astrology believers often tend to selectively remember those predictions that turned out to be true and do not remember those that turned out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not.: 180–181 Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.: 180–181 The Barnum effect is the tendency for an individual to give a high accuracy rating to a description of their personality that supposedly tailored specifically for them, but is, in fact, vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. If more information is requested for a prediction, the more accepting people are of the results.: 344 In 1949 Bertram Forer conducted a personality test on students in his classroom.: 344 Each student was given a supposedly individual assessment but actually all students received the same assessment. The personality descriptions were taken from a book on astrology. When the students were asked to comment on the accuracy of the test, more than 40% gave it the top mark of 5 out of 5, and the average rating was 4.2.: 134, 135 The results of this study have been replicated in numerous other studies.: 382 The study of the Barnum/Forer effect has been focused mostly on the level of acceptance of fake horoscopes and fake astrological personality profiles.: 382 Recipients of these personality assessments consistently fail to distinguish between common and uncommon personality descriptors.: 383 In a study by Paul Rogers and Janice Soule (2009), which was consistent with previous research on the issue, it was found that those who believed in astrology are generally more susceptible to giving more credence to the Barnum profile than sceptics.: 393 By a process known as self-attribution, it has been shown in numerous studies that individuals with knowledge of astrology tend to describe their personalities in terms of traits compatible with their sun signs. The effect is heightened when the individuals were aware that the personality description was being used to discuss astrology. Individuals who were not familiar with astrology had no such tendency. Sociology[edit] In 1953, sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society.: 326 Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably led to statements that encouraged conformity—and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs.: 327 Adorno concluded that astrology was a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, \"Occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes.\": 329 False balance is where a false, unaccepted or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies \"there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not\". During Wonders of the Solar System, a TV programme by the BBC, the physicist Brian Cox said: \"Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish, Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet. And it's through a force... gravity.\" This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint. Following the complaints of astrology believers, Cox gave the following statement to the BBC: \"I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear. I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation.\" In the programme Stargazing Live, Cox further commented by saying: \"in the interests of balance on the BBC, yes astrology is nonsense.\" In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ, editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur. Studies and polling have shown that the belief in astrology is higher in Western countries than might otherwise be expected. In 2012, in polls 42% of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific.: 7/25 This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge.: 345 Some of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy (the scientific study of celestial objects). The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language.: 344, 346 A plain description of astrology as an \"occult influence of stars, planets etc. on human affairs\" had no impact on the general public's assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 eurobarometer poll. This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public, of any wording ending in \"-ology\" with a legitimate field of knowledge.: 346 In Eurobarometers 224 and 225 performed in 2004, a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording. In half of the polls, the word \"astrology\" was used, while in the other the word \"horoscope\" was used.: 349 Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76%, but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43%. In particular, belief that astrology was very scientific was 26% while that of horoscopes was 7%.: 352 This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology.: 362 See also[edit] List of topics characterized as pseudoscience Religion and science Notes[edit] ^ Gauquelin attributed this phenomenon to the increase in \"artificial\" birth hours due to the increased use of surgery to deliver babies (C'est écrit dans les astres, p. 240 & Les Horloges cosmiques p. 200). ^ The level of confidence was self rated by the astrologers themselves. ^ Also discussed in Martens, Ronny; Trachet, Tim (1998).

To optimise the chances of finding even remote relationships between date of birth and individual differences in personality and intelligence we further applied two different strategies. The first one was based on the common chronological concept of time (e.g. month of birth and season of birth). The second strategy was based on the (pseudo-scientific) concept of astrology (e.g. Sun Signs, The Elements, and astrological gender), as discussed in the book Astrology: Science or superstition? by Eysenck and Nias (1982). ^ Vishveshwara, S.K.; Biswas, D.C.V.; Mallik, C.V., eds.

Barnum, whose circus act provided \"a little something for everyone\", it refers to the idea that people believe a statement about their personality that is vague or trivial if they think that it derives from some systematic procedure tailored especially for them (Dickson & Kelly, 1985; Furnham & Schofield, 1987; Rogers & Soule, 2009; Wyman & Vyse, 2008). For example, the more birth detail is used in an astrological prediction or horoscope, the more credulous people tend to be (Furnham, 1991). However, confirmation bias means that people do not tend to pay attention to other information that might disconfirm the credibility of the predictions. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o Pigliucci, Massimo (2010).

The Barnum effect is a robust phenomenon, having been demonstrated in clinical, occupational, educational, forensic, and military settings as well as numerous ostensibly paranormal contexts (Dickson & Kelly, 1985; Furnham & Schofield, 1987; Snyder, Shenkel & Lowery, 1977; Thiriart, 1991). In the first Barnum study, Forer (1949) administered, astrological believers deemed a Barnum profile supposedly derived from astrology was a better description of their own personality than did astrological skeptics. This was true regardless of the respondent's ethnicity or apparent profile source. This reinforces still further the view that individuals who endorse astrological beliefs are prone to judging the legitimacy and usefulness of horoscopes according to their a priori expectations. ^ Wunder, Edgar (1 December 2003). \"Self-attribution, sun-sign traits, and the alleged role of favourableness as a moderator variable: long-term effect or artefact?\". Personality and Individual Differences. 35 (8): 1783–1789. doi:10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00002-3. The effect was replicated several times (Eysenck & Nias 1981,1982; Fichten & Sunerton, 1983; Jackson, 1979; Kelly, 1982; Smithers and Cooper, 1978), even if no reference to astrology was made until the debriefing of the subjects (Hamilton, 1995; Van Rooij, 1994, 1999), or if the data were gathered originally for a purpose that has nothing to do with astrology (Clarke, Gabriels, and Barnes, 1996; Van Rooij, Brak, & Commandeur, 1988), but the effect is stronger when a cue is given to the subjects that the study is about astrology (Van Rooij 1994). Early evidence for sun-sign derived self-attribution effects has already been reported by Silverman (1971) and Delaney & Woodyard (1974). In studies with subjects unfamiliar with the meaning of the astrological sun-sign symbolism, no effect was observed (Fourie, 1984; Jackson & Fiebert, 1980; Kanekar & Mukherjee, 1972; Mohan, Bhandari, & Meena, 1982; Mohan and Gulati, 1986; Saklofske, Kelly, & McKerracher, 1982; Silverman & Whitmer, 1974; Veno & Pamment, 1979). ^ a b c Cary J.

Millions of people live in poor health because of it. Researchers estimate that every year around 8 million people die an early death due to smoking.It has been a major health problem for many decades. For the entire 20th century, it is estimated that around 100 million people died prematurely because of smoking, most of them in rich countries.1The share of smokers among the world population is falling, and because smoking is such a large health problem today, this is one of the most positive developments in global health. It makes it possible for millions of people to live a longer and healthier life.For a brief overview of the most important facts, see the following article:Smoking: How large of a global problem is it? And how can we make progress against it?Every year, around 8 million people die prematurely as a result of smoking. But there are things we can do to prevent this.Other research and writing on smoking on Our World in Data:In which countries do people smoke the most?Who smokes more, men or women?Why is life expectancy in the US lower than in other rich countries?How do researchers estimate the death toll caused by each risk factor, whether it’s smoking, obesity, or air pollution?Smoking is one of the leading risks for early deathSmoking is responsible for about 8 million premature deaths each yearThe two regularly updated studies on the global death toll from tobacco use – published by the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation – agree that around 8 million people die prematurely yearly.The aggregate statistics refer to ‘tobacco use’ (rather than smoking alone) because other forms of consuming tobacco, such as chewing tobacco, also lead to premature deaths. The huge majority of deaths from tobacco use, however, are due to smoking. The death toll from smoking is very close to the total sum of deaths from tobacco use (higher than 99.9% in the case of the IHME estimates).World Health Organization: More than 8 million die from tobacco use every yearThe WHO estimates that more than 8 million people die prematurely yearly from tobacco use. This is the latest available WHO estimate as of November 2023.2More than 7 million of those deaths result from direct tobacco use. About 1.3 million are non-smokers who are dying because they are exposed to second-hand smoke.IHME's Global Burden of Disease study: 8.7 million die from tobacco use every yearThe IHME – in their annual Global Burden of Disease study – estimates that 8.7 million people die prematurely from tobacco use every year. As of November 2023, these are the latest estimates and refer to deaths in the year 2019. The references can be found in the footnote.37.7 million of those deaths result from smoking, while 1.3 million are non-smokers who are dying because they are exposed to second-hand smoke. (An additional 56,000 people die annually from chewing tobacco.)Most (71%) of those who die prematurely from smoking are men.These estimates of the annual number of deaths attributed to a wide range of risk factors are shown in the interactive chart. This visualization is, by default, showing the global total, but can be explored for any country or region using the \"change country\" option. Smoking is a risk factor for several of the world's leading causes of death, including lung and other forms of cancer, heart disease, and respiratory diseases. Click to open interactive versionSmoking led to about 100 million premature deaths in the 20th-centuryTobacco smoking has been one of the world's largest health problems for decades. Over the course of the 20th century, it killed around 100 million people, most of them in today's rich countries.1 The health burdens of smoking are now moving from high-income to low-to-middle-income countries; some estimates have suggested that one billion people could die from tobacco over the 21st century.4The global distribution of smoking deathsIn many countries, a high share of deaths is attributed to smokingIn the map, we see the share of deaths attributed to direct smoking across the world. In many countries, this share is substantial. Click to open interactive versionRelated – the share of deaths from secondhand smoking: This map shows the share of premature deaths attributed to secondhand smoke across the world.Death rates from smoking are highest across Asia and Eastern EuropeIn the interactive map, we show death rates from tobacco smoking across the world. Death rates measure the number of premature deaths from smoking per 100,000 people in a given country or region.We see large differences in death rates across the world. Rates tend to be highest across Asia and Eastern Europe, where figures are often over 100, and in some cases, over 150 deaths per 100,000 people.Death rates are much lower across some of the lowest-income countries in the world, where very few people smoke. Click to open interactive versionRelated – the number of deaths from smoking. This map shows the annual number of deaths from tobacco smoking across the world.Most deaths from smoking occur in older populationsWhen we look at the breakdown of deaths from smoking by age, we see that it is mainly older populations that are affected.In the visualizations, we show the death rates from smoking by age bracket and the share of annual deaths that occur in each age group.Here, we see that death rates from smoking are much higher in people older than 70 years old, followed by those aged 50 to 69. Click to open interactive version Click to open interactive versionHow has the death toll due to smoking changed over time?Death rates from smoking have declined in most countriesGlobally, smoking-related death rates have fallen.But there are differences across countries. Where in the world are death rates falling or rising?In the scatterplot, we see the comparison of smoking death rates in 1990 (shown on the y-axis) versus the death rate in the latest data (on the x-axis). The grey line is the line of parity: countries that lie along this line had equal death rates at both points in time. Countries that lie above the grey line had higher death rates in 1990; for those that lie below the grey line, the opposite is true.We see that almost all countries in the world lie above the grey line. This means that most countries have achieved a decline in death rates from smoking in recent decades. Click to open interactive versionPrevalence of smoking across the worldShare of smokers among the populationIn which countries do people smoke the most?Around one-in-four adults in the world smoke tobacco.But where in the world is smoking most common?In the map, we see the share of adults aged 15 years and older who smoke tobacco.There are a number of countries where more than a third of the population smokes. The places where many people smoke are clustered in regions. South-East Asia, the Pacific islands, and parts of Europe.In some countries, very few people smoke.Several factors influence the prevalence of smoking. One is prosperity: if we look at the relationship between smoking prevalence and income, we find that richer countries tend to smoke more. But as you see in this correlation, there are very large differences at each level of income.Smoking rates are high across many countries, but we know from the history of many countries that this can change quickly. Many of today’s high-income countries had much higher smoking rates in the past and have seen a large reduction.The prevalence of smoking also differs significantly between men and women. In this article, we look at sex differences in smoking across the world. Click to open interactive versionDaily smokersThis visualization shows the share of adults, aged 15 years and older, who smoke every day.We see that daily smoking is most common across Europe and Asia – more than 20% of adults in most countries in these regions smoke every day. Click to open interactive versionRelated – number of daily smokers. This map shows the number of people who smoke every day across the world.Smoking by genderWho smokes more, men or women?Nearly one-in-four adults in the world smokes tobacco. But there are large differences between men and women.More than one-third of men in the world smoke. Less than one-in-ten women do.In almost all countries, it is true that a large share of men smoke. In the visualization, we see the share of men who smoke (plotted on the vertical axis) compared with the same metric for women (plotted on the horizontal axis).The grey line in the plot represents equality in the prevalence: countries where smoking is more common in men will lie above this line, and countries where more women smoke lie below.We see that almost all countries lie above the grey line, meaning a higher share of men smoke. There are only a few exceptions.In many countries — particularly across Asia and Africa — the differences are very large.We also see this when we look at a global map of smoking among women: across much of Africa and Asia, rates are very low. For comparison, here is the world map of smoking rates in men.The fact that men are more likely than women to smoke is reflected in health statistics, particularly lung cancer, for which smoking is a primary risk factor. We see that in nearly every country in the world, men are more likely to die from lung cancer. Click to open interactive versionRelated – number of daily smokers by sex. This chart details the number of men and women who smoke daily.How has the prevalence of smoking changed over time?The rise and fall of smokingThe smoking of cigarettes first saw a significant rise across today's rich countries in the early 20th century. Since then, trends in smoking have undergone a century-long cycle of peak and decline.In the visualization, we see the average number of cigarettes sold per adult per day across many of today's rich countries, including the United States and European countries.Here, we see that all countries followed a very similar trajectory: a steep rise in cigarette consumption during the early-to-mid 1900s, peaking from the mid-to-latter half of the century before entering into a steep decline in the decades which followed.Notably, this rise-peak-fall pathway took around a century in all cases. This long trajectory has had major health impacts on the populations of rich countries today. Click to open interactive versionSmoking rates are now falling in almost all countriesThe rise, peak, and decline of smoking in rich countries took around a century. The high peak had severe health impacts.This timescale is important when we consider low-to-middle-income countries today: if they are to avoid the scale of the health consequences seen by rich countries, they must move through this pathway much quicker. The positive news is that most have – smoking is already falling in most countries today.In this visualization, we see the share of adults who smoked in the year 2000 (on the y-axis) and in the most recent data (on the x-axis). The grey line here shows parity: countries that lie along this line would have the same smoking prevalence at both points in time. Countries that lie above this line had higher smoking prevalence back in 2000; for those below the opposite is true.We see that most countries lie above the grey line: this means the share of adults who smoke has declined in most countries in the world over the past decade. This is a surprising fact to many, since it means smoking prevalence is not only falling in high-income countries but also in most low-to-middle incomes.5Low-to-middle income countries have effectively 'leapfrogged' the century-long rise-peak-decline pathway of rich countries. Almost everywhere, smoking is on the decline. Click to open interactive versionSmoking and cancerThe rise and fall of lung cancerThis chart shows death rates from lung cancer in the US since 1950. It is possible to view the data for other countries by using the tools in the chart.We see the same rise, peak, and decline pattern that we have seen in the cigarette consumption statistics.These trends are largely driven by the trends in smoking. Smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer and we see that the trends in lung cancer follow those in smoking with a lag. Click to open interactive versionShare of cancer deaths attributed to smokingThe world map shows the Global Burden of Disease estimates of the share of cancer deaths that can be attributed to smoking.Globally, about a quarter of cancer deaths are attributed to smoking.In most richer countries, the share is even higher.In poor countries, where fewer people were smoking in the past, tobacco is responsible for a smaller fraction of cancer deaths.

Standard German[edit] German is the national official language and constitutes a lingua franca and de facto first language: most Austrians other than (mostly rural) seniors are able to speak it. It is the language used in media, in schools, and formal announcements. The variety of German used, Austrian German, is partially influenced by Austro-Bavarian. Alemannic[edit] Alemannic, i.e., Swiss German, is spoken by about 300,000 people, mostly in Vorarlberg. Vorarlberg uses a High Alemannic, the same dialect group as that spoken in Northern Switzerland (outside Basel) and parts of southern Alsace, France. To most German-speakers, it is very difficult to understand. Austro-Bavarian[edit] The main native language of Austria outside Vorarlberg is Austro-Bavarian. It has approximately 8.3 million speakers in Austria. The north-eastern parts of Austria (with the capital Vienna) speak Central Austro-Bavarian dialects and the southern parts Southern Austro-Bavarian dialects. Austro-Bavarian differs greatly from Standard German, making it very difficult for German speakers of different regions to understand the native population. Austro-Bavarian has no official orthography, but there are literary efforts (de:Dialektliteratur), especially in poems, to depict the sound of the pronunciation in the spelling. Other words can only be heard while visiting particular regions of Austria and Bavaria; such words/phrases are only rarely used in Standard German. These include \"Griaß God\" (literally: \"greet god\" = may god greet you), and \"Servus/Servas\" (at your service) as greeting phrases. Other terms are strictly dialectal, like \"Pfiat di / Pfiat eich (euch)\" (literally: \"watch over you [God]\" = may God watch over you), meaning \"goodbye\". Minority languages[edit] Main article: Minority languages of Austria A number of minority languages are spoken in Austria, some of which have official status. According to the European Commission, Austria's \"recognised minority languages are Hungarian, Slovenian, Burgenland-Croatian, Czech, Slovak, Romany and sign language. In the mixed-language districts of Carinthia, Slovene is also considered an official language. In some districts of Burgenland, Hungarian and Croatian have equal status to German as an official language.\" About 250 languages are spoken throughout Austria, though many have very small populations of speakers. Only about 20 languages (apart from official languages of Austria) have more than 10,000 speakers. Non-Official Languages with 10,000+ speakers in Austria (2021) Language Number of Speakers (in Austria) Spanish 302,100 (L1: 11,100) Turkish 204,000 Serbian 197,000 Russian 150,000 (L1: 9,390) Romanian 18,800 Slovak 11,400 Slovene 27,600 Polish 34,000 Persian (Iranian) 11,900 Italian 795,900 (L1: 11,900) French 1,181,300 (L1: 11,300) Hungarian 45,100 Czech 19,700 Croatian 146,000 Chinese (Mandarin) 11,100 Bergenland Croatian 21,600 Bosnian 38,800 Arabic (Levantine) 19,600 Albanian (Gheg) 31,400 Albanian (Tosk) 28,200 Turkish[edit] Turkish is the largest minority language, in a situation mirroring that of Germany, spoken by 2.3% of the population. Serbian[edit] Serbian is the one of the largest minority languages in Austria. In 2021, there were 197,000 Serbian speakers in Austria, according to Ethnologue. Romanian[edit] In 2021, Ethnologue reports there were an estimated 18,800 Romanian speakers in Austria. Burgenland Croatian[edit] Burgenland Croatian, an official language in Austrian Burgenland, is spoken by 2.5% of Austrians, and Burgenland Croats are recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag) of 1955. Hungarian[edit] See also: Hungarian dialects While little spoken today, Hungarian has traditionally held an important position in Austria due to the historical ties between the two countries. Today, Hungarian is spoken by around 1,000 people in Burgenland. Slovene[edit] Main articles: Jaun Valley dialect, Ebriach dialect, Rosen Valley dialect, and Gail Valley dialect Areas in Carinthia where Slovene is spoken by above 5% (light-blue) to above 30% (dark-blue) of the population. Slovene is an official language in Austrian Carinthia. As of the census in 2001[update] Slovene is used by 12,686 Austrians as vernacular, and it is reported that Slovene can be spoken by 0.3% of Austrians. Carinthian Slovenes are recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights and affirmative action following the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag) of 1955. European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages[edit] Austria ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages on 28 June 2001 for the following languages in respect of specific Länder: Croatian of Burgenland Slovene (in Carinthia and Styria) Hungarian (in Burgenland and Vienna) Czech (in Vienna) Slovak (in Vienna) Romani (in Burgenland) References[edit] This article incorporates public domain material from The World Factbook (2024 ed.).

For harmful chemicals emitted by aircraft, see Environmental impact of aviation. For attempts to influence weather with aircraft, see Cloud seeding. For the use of aircraft to apply pesticide and herbicide, see Crop dusting. For the Beck song, see Chemtrails (song). An Airbus A340's engines leaving a water condensation trail (contrail) – miniature clouds formed by the engine exhaust The chemtrail conspiracy theory /ˈkɛmtreɪl/ is the erroneous belief that long-lasting condensation trails left in the sky by high-flying aircraft are actually \"chemtrails\" consisting of chemical or biological agents, sprayed for nefarious purposes undisclosed to the general public. Believers in this conspiracy theory say that while normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly, contrails that linger must contain additional substances. Those who subscribe to the theory speculate that the purpose of the chemical release may be solar radiation management, weather modification, psychological manipulation, human population control, biological or chemical warfare, or testing of biological or chemical agents on a population, and that the trails are causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems. The claim has been dismissed by the scientific community. There is no evidence that purported chemtrails differ from normal water-based contrails routinely left by high-flying aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions. Proponents have tried to prove that chemical spraying occurs, but their analyses have been flawed or based on misconceptions. Because of the conspiracy theory's persistence and questions about government involvement, scientists and government agencies around the world have repeatedly explained that the supposed chemtrails are in fact normal contrails. The term chemtrail is a portmanteau of the words chemical and trail, just as contrail blends condensation and trail. History Multiple concurrent contrails. How long they last depends upon the weather, especially the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Chemtrail conspiracy theories began to circulate after the United States Air Force (USAF) published a 1996 report about weather modification. In the late 1990s, the USAF was accused of \"spraying the U.S. population with mysterious substances\" from aircraft \"generating unusual contrail patterns.\" The theories were posted on Internet forums by people including Richard Finke and William Thomas and were among many conspiracy theories popularized by late-night radio host Art Bell, starting in 1999. As the chemtrail conspiracy theory spread, federal officials were flooded with angry calls and letters. A multi-agency response attempting to dispel the rumors was published in 2000 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Many chemtrail believers interpreted agency fact sheets as further evidence of the existence of a government cover-up. The EPA refreshed its posting in 2015. In the early 2000s, the USAF released an undated fact sheet that stated the conspiracy theories were a hoax fueled in part by citations to a 1996 strategy paper drafted within their Air University titled Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025. The paper was presented in response to a military directive to outline a future strategic weather modification system for the purpose of maintaining the United States' military dominance in the year 2025, and identified as \"fictional representations of future situations/scenarios.\" The USAF further clarified in 2005 that the paper \"does not reflect current military policy, practice, or capability\" and that it is \"not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future.\" Additionally, the USAF states that the \"'chemtrail' hoax has been investigated and refuted by many established and accredited universities, scientific organizations, and major media publications.\" The conspiracy theories are seldom covered by the mainstream media, and when they are, they are usually cast as an example of anti-government paranoia. For example, in 2013, when it was made public that the CIA, NASA, and NOAA intended to provide funds to the National Academy of Sciences to conduct research into methods to counteract global warming with geoengineering, an article in the International Business Times anticipated that \"the idea of any government agency looking at ways to control, or manipulate, the weather will be met with scrutiny and fears of a malign conspiracies\" [sic], and mentioned chemtrail conspiracy theories as an example. Description Proponents of the chemtrail conspiracy theory find support for their theories in their interpretations of sky phenomena, videos posted to the Internet, and reports about government programs; they also have certain beliefs about the goals of the alleged conspiracy and the effects of its alleged efforts and generally take certain actions based on those beliefs. Interpretation of evidence Airbus A380 water-filled tanks simulate passenger weight for different takeoff and landing displacement weights. Similar photographs are sometimes said to show chemtrail planes in action.Ballast barrels with water in a prototype Boeing 747 flight-test plane Proponents of the chemtrail conspiracy theory say that chemtrails can be distinguished from contrails by their long duration, asserting that the chemtrails are those trails left by aircraft that persist for as much as a half-day or transform into cirrus-like clouds. The proponents claim that after 1995, contrails had a different chemical composition and lasted a lot longer in the sky; proponents fail to acknowledge evidence of long-lasting contrails shown in World War II–era photographs. Proponents characterize contrails as streams that persist for hours and that, with their criss-cross, grid-like, or parallel stripe patterns, eventually blend to form large clouds. Proponents view the presence of visible color spectra in the streams, unusual concentrations of sky tracks in a single area, or lingering tracks left by unmarked or military airplanes flying atypical altitudes or locations as markers of chemtrails. Photographs of barrels installed in the passenger space of an aircraft for flight test purposes have been claimed to show aerosol dispersion systems. The barrels' actual purpose is to simulate the weight of passengers or cargo. The barrels are filled with water, and the water can be pumped from barrel to barrel to test different centers of gravity while the aircraft is in flight. Former CIA employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden, interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience, said he had searched through all the secret information of the U.S. government for evidence about (aliens and) chemtrails. According to a CNN report about the webcast, he said: \"In case you were wondering: ... Chemtrails are not a thing\" and \"I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups. I couldn't find anything\". Jim Marrs has cited a 2007 Louisiana television station report as evidence for chemtrails. In the report, the air underneath a crosshatch of supposed chemtrails was measured and apparently found to contain unsafe levels of barium: at 6.8 parts per million, three times the nationally recommended limit. But a subsequent analysis of the footage showed that the equipment had been misused and the reading exaggerated by a factor of 100—the true level of barium measured was both usual and safe. In 2014, a video that went viral showed a commercial passenger airplane landing on a foggy night, which was described as emitting chemtrails. Discovery News pointed out that passengers sitting behind the wings would clearly see anything being sprayed, which would defeat any intent to be secretive, and that the purported chemical emission was normal air disruption caused by the wings, visible due to the fog. In October 2014, Englishman Chris Bovey filmed a video of a plane jettisoning fuel on a flight from Buenos Aires to London, which had to dump fuel to lighten its load for an emergency landing in São Paulo. The clip went viral on Facebook, with over three million views and more than 52,000 shares, cited as evidence of chemtrails. He later disclosed that the video post was done as a prank. In some accounts, the chemicals are described as barium and aluminum salts, polymer fibers, thorium, or silicon carbide. Chemtrail believers interpret the existence of cloud seeding programs and research into climate engineering as evidence of the conspiracy. Beliefs Various versions of the chemtrail conspiracy theory have been propagated via the Internet and radio programs. There are websites dedicated to the conspiracy theory, and it is particularly favored by far-right groups because it fits well with a deep suspicion of the government. A 2014 review of 20 chemtrail websites found that believers appeal to science in some of their arguments but do not believe what academic or government-employed scientists say; scientists and federal agencies have consistently denied that chemtrails exist, explaining the sky tracks are simply persistent contrails. The review also found that believers generally hold that chemtrails are evidence of a global conspiracy; they allege various goals which include profit (for example, manipulating futures prices, or making people sick to benefit drug companies), population control, or weapons testing (use of weather as a weapon, or testing bioweapons). One of these ideas is that clouds are being seeded with electrically conductive materials as part of a massive electromagnetic superweapons program based around the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP). Believers say chemtrails are toxic; the 2014 review found that they generally hold that every person is under attack and often express fear, anxiety, sadness, and anger about this. A 2011 study of people from the US, Canada, and the UK found that 2.6% of the sample believed entirely in the conspiracy theory, and 14% believed it partially. An analysis of responses given to the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study showed that 9% of the 36,000 respondents believed it was \"completely true\" that \"the government has a secret program that uses airplanes to put harmful chemicals into the air\" while a further 19% believed this was \"somewhat true\". Chemtrail conspiracy theorists often describe their experience as being akin to a religious conversion experience. When they \"wake up\" and become \"aware\" of chemtrails, the experience motivates them to advocacy of various forms. For example, they often attend events and conferences on geoengineering, and have sent threats to academics working in geoengineering. Some chemtrail believers adopt the notions of Wilhelm Reich, who devised a \"cloudbuster\" device from pipework. Reich claimed this device would influence weather and remove harmful energy from the atmosphere. Some chemtrail believers have built cloudbusters filled with crystals and metal filings, which are pointed at the sky in an attempt to clear it of chemtrails. Chemtrail believers sometimes gather samples and have them tested, rather than rely on reports from government or academic laboratories, but their experiments are usually flawed; for example, collecting samples in jars with metal lids contaminates the sample and is not done in scientific testing. Incidents In 2001, in response to requests from constituents, U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich introduced (but did not author) H.R. 2977 (107th), the Space Preservation Act of 2001, which would have permanently prohibited basing weapons in space, listing chemtrails as one of a number of \"exotic weapons\" that would be banned. Proponents have interpreted this explicit reference to chemtrails as official government acknowledgment of their existence. Skeptics note that the bill in question also mentions \"extraterrestrial weapons\" and \"environmental, climate, or tectonic weapons\". The bill received an unfavorable evaluation from the United States Department of Defense and died in committee, with no mention of chemtrails appearing in the text of any of Kucinich's three subsequent failed attempts to enact a Space Preservation Act. In 2003, in a response to a petition by concerned Canadian citizens that \"chemicals used in aerial sprayings are adversely affecting the health of Canadians\", the Government House Leader responded: \"There is no substantiated evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the allegation that there is high altitude spraying conducted in Canadian airspace. The term 'chemtrails' is a popularised expression, and there is no scientific evidence to support their existence.\" The House leader added, \"it is our belief that the petitioners are seeing regular airplane condensation trails or contrails.\" In 2005 in the United Kingdom, Elliot Morley, a Minister of State for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was asked by David Drew, the Labour Party Member of Parliament for Stroud, \"what research [the] Department has undertaken into the polluting effects of chemtrails for aircraft\", and responded that \"the Department is not researching into chemtrails from aircraft as they are not scientifically recognised phenomena\", and that work was being conducted to understand \"how contrails are formed and what effects they have on the atmosphere.\" During the 2011–2017 California drought, some local politicians in Shasta County reacted credulously to conspiracy theories suggesting that weather-modifying chemtrails had caused the unusual weather conditions. Contrails Main article: Contrail Contrails from propeller-driven aircraft engine exhaust, early 1940s Contrails, or condensation trails, are \"streaks of condensed water vapor created in the air by an airplane or rocket at high altitudes\". Fossil fuel combustion (as in piston and jet engines) produces carbon dioxide and water vapor. At high altitudes, the air is very cold. Hot humid air from the engine exhaust mixes with the colder surrounding air, causing the water vapor to condense into droplets or ice crystals that form visible clouds. The rate at which contrails dissipate is entirely dependent on weather conditions. If the atmosphere is near saturation, the contrail may exist for some time. Conversely, if the atmosphere is dry, the contrail will dissipate quickly. Exhaust gases and emissionsWingtip condensation trails It is well established by atmospheric scientists that contrails can persist for hours, and that it is normal for them to spread out into cirrus sheets. The different-sized ice crystals in contrails descend at different rates, which spreads the contrail vertically. Then the differential in wind speeds between altitudes (wind shear) results in the horizontal spreading of the contrail. This mechanism is similar to the formation of cirrus uncinus clouds. Contrails between 25,000 and 40,000 feet (7,600 and 12,200 m) can often merge into an \"almost solid\" interlaced sheet. Contrails can have a lateral spread of several kilometers, and given sufficient air traffic, it is possible for contrails to create an entirely overcast sky that increases the ice budget of individual contrails and persists for hours. Contrail testing being carried out on an Airbus A340 and much older Boeing 707 Experts on atmospheric phenomena say that the characteristics attributed to chemtrails are simply features of contrails responding to diverse conditions in terms of sunlight, temperature, horizontal and vertical wind shear, and humidity levels present at the aircraft's altitude. In the US, the gridlike nature of the National Airspace System's flight lanes tends to cause crosshatched contrails, and in general it is hard to discern from the ground whether overlapping contrails are at similar altitudes or not. The jointly published fact sheet produced by NASA, the EPA, the FAA, and NOAA in 2000 in response to alarms over chemtrails details the science of contrail formation, and outlines both the known and potential impacts of contrails have on temperature and climate. The USAF produced a fact sheet that described these contrail phenomena as observed and analyzed since at least 1953. It also rebutted chemtrail theories more directly by identifying the theories as a hoax and disproving the existence of chemtrails. Patrick Minnis, an atmospheric scientist with NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, has said that logic does not dissuade most chemtrail proponents: \"If you try to pin these people down and refute things, it's, 'Well, you're just part of the conspiracy'\", he said. Analysis of the use of commercial aircraft tracks for climate engineering has shown them to be generally unsuitable. Astronomer Bob Berman has characterized the chemtrail conspiracy theory as a classic example of failure to apply Occam's razor, writing in 2009 that instead of adopting the long-established \"simple solution\" that the trails consist of frozen water vapour, \"the conspiracy web sites think the phenomenon started only a decade ago and involves an evil scheme in which 40,000 commercial pilots and air traffic controllers are in on the plot to poison their own children.\" A 2016 survey of 77 atmospheric scientists concluded that \"76 out of 77 (98.7%) of scientists that took part in this study said they had not encountered evidence of a [secret large-scale atmospheric program] (SLAP), and that the data cited as evidence could be explained through other factors, such as typical contrail formation and poor data sampling instructions presented on SLAP websites.\" See also California drought manipulation conspiracy theory Cloud iridescence Environmental effects of aviation Environmental engineering Herbicidal warfare LGBT chemicals conspiracy theory Mick West (chemtrail skeptic) Mobile source air pollution Stratospheric aerosol injection References ^ Science, Carnegie (12 August 2016). \"\"Chemtrails\" not real, say leading atmospheric science experts\".

Conspiracy theorists say that government officials or others are using jets to spray harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. They cite the contrails left by jets as evidence of the chemicals. The EPA has added a new notice to its website, which links to a fact sheet explaining that the trails left by jets in the atmosphere are only ice particles and contain no harmful chemicals. \"Contrails are line-shaped clouds or 'Condensation trails' composed of ice particles that are visible behind jet aircraft engines under certain atmospheric conditions and at times can persist\", says the notice, posted to the EPA's website Friday. \"EPA is not aware of any deliberate actions to release chemical or biological agents into the atmosphere\". Theorists have posited that the chemicals are meant to control the climate, harm humans, or kill them. The fact sheet from the EPA and other federal agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was first published in 2000 when the chemtrails conspiracy became popular on the Web.

The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase \"countries within a country\" to describe the United Kingdom. Although the United Kingdom is a unitary sovereign country, it contains three distinct legal jurisdictions in Scotland, England and Wales, and Northern Ireland, each retaining its own legal system even after joining the UK. Since 1998, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have also gained significant autonomy through the process of devolution. The Parliament of the United Kingdom and British Government deal with all reserved matters for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, but not in general matters that have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament, and the Welsh Senedd. Additionally, devolution in Northern Ireland is conditional on co-operation between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland (see North/South Ministerial Council) and the British Government consults with the Government of Ireland to reach agreement on some non-devolved matters for Northern Ireland (see British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference). England, comprising the majority of the population and area of the United Kingdom, remains fully the responsibility of the United Kingdom Parliament centralised in London. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales are not themselves listed in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) list of countries. However, the ISO list of the subdivisions of the United Kingdom, compiled by British Standards and the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics, uses \"country\" to describe England, Scotland, and Wales. Northern Ireland, in contrast, is described as a \"province\" in the same lists. Each has separate national governing bodies for sports and compete separately in many international sporting competitions, including the Commonwealth Games. Northern Ireland also forms joint All-Island sporting bodies with the Republic of Ireland for some sports, including rugby union. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are dependencies of the Crown and are not part of the UK. Similarly, the British Overseas Territories, remnants of the British Empire, are not part of the UK. From 1801, following the Acts of Union, until 1922 the whole island of Ireland was a country within the UK. Ireland was split into two separate jurisdictions in 1921, becoming Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland. Pursuant to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the institutions of the revolutionary Irish Republic were assimilated into Southern Ireland, which then became the Irish Free State and left the United Kingdom in 1922. The Irish Free State adopted a new, essentially republican constitution in 1937 – albeit retaining the King for diplomatic functions – by which it would be known as simply Ireland. In 1949, by the Republic of Ireland Act, it transferred these diplomatic functions to its own president, left the Commonwealth of Nations and adopted the description Republic of Ireland, by which it is now known.

Further Acts meant this combined territory was referred to in law simply as 'England' from 1746 until 1967. Wales was described (in varying combinations) as the \"country\", \"principality\", and \"dominion\" of Wales. The Laws in Wales Acts have subsequently been repealed. The Acts of Union 1707 refer to both England and Scotland as a \"part\" of a united kingdom of Great Britain The Acts of Union 1800 use \"part\" in the same way to refer to England and Scotland. However, they use the word \"country\" to describe Great Britain and Ireland respectively, when describing trade between them The Government of Ireland Act 1920 described Great Britain, Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland as \"countries\" in provisions relating to taxation. The Northern Ireland Act 1998, which repealed the Government of Ireland Act 1920, does not use any term to describe Northern Ireland. Current legal terminology[edit] The Interpretation Act 1978 provides statutory definitions of the terms \"England\", \"Wales\" and the \"United Kingdom\", but neither that Act nor any other current statute defines \"Scotland\" or \"Northern Ireland\". Use of the first three terms in other legislation is interpreted following the definitions in the 1978 Act. The definitions in the 1978 Act are listed below: \"England\" means, \"subject to any alteration of boundaries under Part IV of the Local Government Act 1972, the area consisting of the counties established by section 1 of that Act, Greater London and the Isles of Scilly.\" This definition applies from 1 April 1974. \"United Kingdom\" means \"Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\" This definition applies from 12 April 1927. \"Wales\" means the combined area of the 8 Preserved counties of Wales as outlined section 20 of the Local Government Act 1972, as originally enacted, but subject to any alteration made under section 73 of that Act (consequential alteration of boundary following alteration of watercourse). In 1996 these eight new counties were redistributed into the current 22 unitary authorities. For Welsh law, \"Wales\" and \"Cymru\" are defined in the Legislation (Wales) Act 2019 as \"(a)the combined area of the counties and county boroughs in Wales (see Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 4 to the Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70)), together with (b)the sea adjacent to Wales within the seaward limits of the territorial sea.\" In the Scotland Act 1998 there is no delineation of Scotland, with the definition in section 126 simply providing that Scotland includes \"so much of the internal waters and territorial sea of the United Kingdom as are adjacent to Scotland\". The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 refers to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as \"parts\" of the United Kingdom in the following clause: \"Each constituency shall be wholly in one of the four parts of the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland).\" Other official usage[edit] The Royal Fine Art Commission's 1847 report on decorating the Palace of Westminster referred to \"the nationality of the component parts of the United Kingdom\" being represented by their four respective patron saints. European Union[edit] For the purposes of NUTS 1 collection of statistical data in a format that is compatible with similar data collected in the European Union (on behalf of Eurostat), the United Kingdom was divided into twelve regions of approximately equal size. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were regions in their own right while England was divided into nine regions. Following Brexit, the Office for National Statistics uses International Territorial Level, which is currently a mirror of the NUTS 1 system until the 2024 review. Current[edit] The official term rest of the UK (RUK or rUK) is used in Scotland, for example in export statistics and in legislating for student funding. The alternative term Home Nations is sometimes used in sporting contexts and may include all of the island of Ireland. Identity and nationality[edit] Further information: Demography of the United Kingdom According to the British Social Attitudes Survey, there are broadly two interpretations of British identity, with ethnic and civic dimensions: The first group, which we term the ethnic dimension, contained the items about birthplace, ancestry, living in Britain, and sharing British customs and traditions. The second, or civic group, contained the items about feeling British, respecting laws and institutions, speaking English, and having British citizenship. Of the two perspectives of British identity, the civic definition has become the dominant idea and in this capacity, Britishness is sometimes considered an institutional or overarching state identity. This has been used to explain why first-, second- and third-generation immigrants are more likely to describe themselves as British, rather than English, Northern Irish, Scottish or Welsh, because it is an \"institutional, inclusive\" identity, that can be acquired through naturalisation and British nationality law; the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom who are from an ethnic minority feel British. However, this attitude is more common in England than in Scotland or Wales; \"white English people perceived themselves as English first and as British second, and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds perceived themselves as British, but none identified as English, a label they associated exclusively with white people\". Contrariwise, in Scotland and Wales \"there was a much stronger identification with each country than with Britain.\" Studies and surveys have reported that the majority of the Scots and Welsh see themselves as both Scottish/Welsh and British though with some differences in emphasis. The Commission for Racial Equality found that with respect to notions of nationality in Britain, \"the most basic, objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English, the Scots and the Welsh\". However, \"English participants tended to think of themselves as indistinguishably English or British, while both Scottish and Welsh participants identified themselves much more readily as Scottish or Welsh than as British\". Some people opted \"to combine both identities\" as \"they felt Scottish or Welsh, but held a British passport and were therefore British\", whereas others saw themselves as exclusively Scottish or exclusively Welsh and \"felt quite divorced from the British, whom they saw as the English\". Commentators have described this latter phenomenon as \"nationalism\", a rejection of British identity because some Scots and Welsh interpret it as \"cultural imperialism imposed\" upon the United Kingdom by \"English ruling elites\", or else a response to a historical misappropriation of equating the word \"English\" with \"British\", which has \"brought about a desire among Scots, Welsh and Irish to learn more about their heritage and distinguish themselves from the broader British identity\". The propensity for nationalistic feeling varies greatly across the UK, and can rise and fall over time. The 2011 census which asked about national identity found that responders in Great Britain predominantly chose English, Welsh and Scottish rather than British. Other research suggests that most people in England, Wales and Scotland tend to see themselves as British but that in Wales and Scotland in particular Scottish and Welshness tends to receive more emphasis. A poll of 1039 Scottish adults conducted by YouGov in August 2016 found that 28% of responders saw themselves as Scottish not British, 28% as more Scottish than British, 29% as Scottish and British whilst 10% described being British as their dominate identity (either more British than Scottish or British not Scottish). A similar poll conducted in Wales during spring 2019 found that 21% saw themselves as Welsh not British, 27% as more Welsh than British, 44% as equally Welsh and British whilst 7% saw themselves as either more or exclusively British. A 2018 survey of 20,000 adults in England found that 80% identified strongly as English and 82% identified strongly as British with the two identities appearing to be closely intertwined. The state-funded Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, part of a joint project between the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast, has addressed the issue of identity since it started polling in 1998. It reported that 37% of people identified as British, whilst 29% identified as Irish and 24% identified as Northern Irish. 3% opted to identify themselves as Ulster, whereas 7% stated 'other'. Of the two main religious groups, 68% of Protestants identified as British as did 6% of Catholics; 60% of Catholics identified as Irish as did 3% of Protestants. 21% of Protestants and 26% of Catholics identified as Northern Irish. For Northern Ireland, however, the results of the Life & Times Survey are not the whole story. The poll asks for a single preference, whereas many people easily identify as any combination of British and Irish, or British, Northern Irish and Irish, or Irish and Northern Irish. The 2014 Life & Times Survey addressed this to an extent by choosing two of the options from the identity question: British and Irish. It found that, while 28% of respondents stated they felt \"British not Irish\" and 26% felt \"Irish not British\", 39% of respondents felt some combination of both identities. Six percent chose 'other description'.[failed verification] The identity question is confounded further by identity with politics and religion, and particularly by a stance on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Again in 2014, the Life & Times Survey asked what respondents felt should be the \"long term future for Northern Ireland\". 66% of respondents felt the future should be as a part of the UK, with or without devolved government. 17% felt that Northern Ireland should unify with the Republic of Ireland. 50% of specifically Roman Catholics considered that the long-term future should be as part of the UK, with 32% opting for separation. 87% of respondents identifying as any Protestant denomination opted for remaining part of the UK, with only 4% opting for separation. Of those respondents who declared no religion, 62% opted for remaining part of the UK, with 9% opting for separation. Following devolution and the significant broadening of autonomous governance throughout the UK in the late 1990s, debate has taken place across the United Kingdom on the relative value of full independence, an option that was rejected by the Scottish people in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Cornwall is administered as a county of England, but the Cornish people are a recognised national minority, included under the terms of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2014. Within Cornwall, 13.8 per cent of the population associated themselves with a Cornish identity, either on its own or combined with other identities, according to the 2011 census. This data, however, was recorded without an available tick box for Cornish, as a result the percentage of the population within Cornwall associating with Cornish identity is likely higher. Competitions[edit] See also: Home Nations Each of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales has separate national governing bodies for sports and competes separately in many international sporting competitions. Each country of the United Kingdom has a national football team, and competes as a separate national team in the various disciplines in the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympic Games, the United Kingdom is represented by the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team, although athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to join the Republic of Ireland's Olympic team. In addition to Northern Ireland having its own national governing bodies for some sports such as association football and netball, for others, such as rugby union and cricket, Northern Ireland participates with the Republic of Ireland in a joint All-Ireland team. England and Wales field a joint cricket team. The United Kingdom participates in the Eurovision Song Contest as a single entity, though there have been calls for separate Scottish and Welsh entrants. In 2017, Wales participated alone in the spin-off Eurovision Choir, followed by a separate entry for Scotland in 2019.

Dawson (2000), An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Lewiston, New York: Edwin Mellen Press, One specific problem – in both general and particular senses – is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state – although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change. ^ J. Whyte; G. FitzGerald (1991), Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford: Oxford University Press, One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historical provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government. ^ D. Murphy (1979), A Place Apart, London: Penguin Books, Next – what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and statelet sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'. ^ \"Countries within a country, number10.gov.uk\".

UK: Bloomsbury Academic. p. 57. ISBN 9781526506337. The laws and legal institutions of Scotland and of England and Wales were not merged by the Union of 1707. Thus, they remain separate 'law areas', with separate court systems (as does Northern Ireland), and it is necessary to distinguish Scots law and English law (and Northern Irish law).; \"The justice system and the constitution\". Courts and Tribunals Judiciary. Archived from the original on 21 May 2023. Retrieved 13 June 2023. The United Kingdom has three separate legal systems; one each for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This reflects its historical origins and the fact that both Scotland and Ireland, and later Northern Ireland, retained their own legal systems and traditions under the Acts of Union 1707 and 1800. ^ 2011 Census – Population. According to the 2011 census, the population of England was 53,012,456, and the population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775, therefore England comprises 84% of the UK population. ^ Region and Country Profiles, Key Statistics and Profiles, October 2013, ONS.

Learn about our editorial policies Close What Is Survivorship Bias? Survivorship bias or survivor bias is the tendency to view the performance of existing stocks or funds in the market as a representative comprehensive sample without regarding those that have gone bust. Survivorship bias can result in the overestimation of historical performance and general attributes of a fund or market index. Survivorship bias risk is the chance of an investor making a misguided investment decision based on published investment fund return data. Key Takeaways Survivorship bias occurs when only the winners are considered while the losers that have disappeared are not considered.This can occur when evaluating mutual fund performance (where merged or defunct funds are not included) or market index performance (where stocks that have been dropped from the index for whatever reason are discarded).Survivorship bias skews the average results upward for the index or surviving funds, causing them to appear to perform better since underperformers have been overlooked. Understanding Survivorship Bias Survivorship bias is a natural singularity that makes the existing funds in the investment market more visible and therefore more highly viewed as a representative sample. Survivorship bias occurs because many funds in the investment market are closed by the investment manager for various reasons leaving existing funds at the forefront of the investing universe. Funds may close for various reasons. Numerous market researchers follow and have reported on the effects of fund closings, highlighting the occurrence of survivorship bias. Market researchers regularly follow fund survivorship bias and fund closings to gauge historical trends and add new dynamics to fund performance monitoring. Numerous studies have been done discussing survivorship bias and its effects. For instance, Morningstar released a research report titled “The Fall of Funds: Why Some Funds Fail” discussing fund closures and their negative consequences for investors. Fund Closings There are two main reasons that funds close. One, the fund may not receive high demand and therefore asset inflows do not warrant keeping the fund open. Two, a fund may be closed by an investment manager due to performance. Performance closings are typically the most common. Investors in the fund are immediately impacted by a fund closing. Companies usually offer two solutions for a fund closing. One, the fund undergoes full liquidation and the investors’ shares are sold. This causes potential tax reporting consequences for the investor. Two, the fund may choose to merge. Merged funds are often the best solution for shareholders since they allow for the special transition of shares typically with no tax reporting requirements. However, the performance of the merged funds is therefore also transitioned and can be a factor in the discussion of survivorship bias. Morningstar is one investment service provider that regularly discusses and reports on survivorship bias. It can be important for investors to be aware of survivorship bias because it may be a factor influencing performance that they are not aware of. While merged funds may take into account closed fund performance, in most cases funds are closed and their performance is not integrated into future reporting. This leads to survivorship bias, since investors may believe that currently, active funds are a true representative of all efforts to manage toward a specific objective historically. Thus, investors may want to include qualitative fund research on a strategy they are interested in investing in to determine if previous managers have tried and failed in the past. Closing to New Investors Funds may close to new investors which is very different than a full fund closing. Closing to new investors may actually be a sign of the popularity of the fund and attention from investors for above-average returns. Reverse Survivorship Bias Reverse survivorship bias describes a far less common situation where low- performers remain in the game, while high performers are inadvertently dropped from the running. An example of reverse survivorship can be observed in the Russell 2000 index that is a subset of the 2000 smallest securities from the Russell 3000. The loser stocks stay small and stay in the small-cap index while the winners leave the index once they become too big and successful.

(Last updated: June 25, 2015) Same-sex couples across Canada As same-sex marriages were legalized in Canada in 2005, census data on legally married and same‑sex couples are available for 2006 and 2011 only. According to the census, the number of same-sex married couples nearly tripled between 2006 and 2011, while the number of same-sex common-law couples rose 15.0%. As a result, married couples represented about 3 in 10 same-sex couples in 2011, nearly twice the share of 16.5% in 2006. 64,575 — The number of same-sex couple families in 2011, up 42.4% from 2006. 21,015 — The number of same-sex married couples. 43,560 — The number of same-sex common-law couples. 0.8% — The proportion of all couples in 2011 who were same-sex couples. 54.5% — The proportion of same-sex couples who were male. 45.5% — The proportion of same-sex couples who were female. 25.3% — The proportion of same-sex married spouses and common-law partners aged 15 to 34. 17.5% — The proportion of opposite-sex married spouses and common-law partners aged 15 to 34. 6.2% — The proportion of same-sex married spouses and common-law partners aged 65 and over. 17.8% — The proportion of opposite-sex married spouses and common-law partners aged 65 and over. 45.6% — The proportion of all same-sex couples in Canada living in Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver. 33.4% — The proportion of all opposite-sex couples in Canada living in Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver.

Sexual orientation The Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.1, was the first Statistics Canada survey to include a question on sexual orientation. 1.7% — The percentage of Canadians aged 18 to 59 who reported in 2014 that they consider themselves to be homosexual (gay or lesbian). 1.3% — The percentage of Canadians aged 18 to 59 who reported in 2014 that they consider themselves to be bisexual. Several concepts can be used to measure sexual orientation. These include behaviour, that is, whether a person's partner or partners are of the same or the opposite sex, and identity, that is, whether a person considers himself or herself to be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. The CCHS uses the concept of identity. Data from other countries suggest that the number of people who consider themselves to be homosexual is much smaller than the number who report having had sexual relations with someone of the same sex. However, people are more willing to answer questions about identity than about behaviour. Sources: Canadian Community Health Survey; \"Canadian Community Health Survey,\" The Daily, Tuesday, June 15, 2004. 1% — The proportion of Canadians aged 18 years and over who identified themselves as homosexual (gay or lesbian) in the 2009 General Social Survey on Victimization. 1% — The proportion of Canadians aged 18 years and over who identified themselves as bisexual in the 2009 General Social Survey on Victimization.

About the same — The rate of homosexuals and bisexuals who had a consultation with a specialist doctor (such as a surgeon, allergist, orthopaedist, urologist/gynaecologist, or psychiatrist) in the past 12 months, compared to heterosexuals. About the same — The rate of homosexuals and bisexuals who had a consultation with a family doctor or other specialist doctor (such as a surgeon, allergist, orthopaedist, urologist/gynaecologist, or psychiatrist) in the past 12 months, compared to heterosexuals. More likely — The probability that homosexuals and bisexuals, when compared to heterosexuals, had a consultation with a psychologist in the past 12 months. Less likely — The probability that homosexuals and bisexuals, when compared to heterosexuals, have a regular medical doctor. More likely — The probability that homosexuals and bisexuals, when compared to heterosexuals, felt they needed health care in the previous 12 months, but did not receive it.

Physical activity and stress 53.8% — The proportion of homosexuals and bisexuals who reported that they were at least moderately physically active in 2014, compared about the same as 53.6% of heterosexuals. 33.4% — The proportion of homosexuals and bisexuals who reported that most of their days were quite a bit or extremely stressful, significantly higher than 26.7% of heterosexuals.

The 2001 Census was the first census in Canada to provide data on same-sex common-law couples. The 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey (Cycle 2.1) was the first Statistics Canada survey to include a question on sexual orientation. The 2006 Census was the first census in Canada to provide data on same‑sex married couples, following the legalization of same‑sex marriage across Canada in 2005. The 2011 Census also provides data on same‑sex couples, both married and common‑law. The 2016 Census and National Household Survey will include questions on same-sex couples, both married and common-law. Statistics Canada goes to great lengths in assuring that its questions—including those questions related to sexual orientation—are relevant and feasible. In testing questions targeted to specialized populations, Statistics Canada found that the positive rapport between the agency and with various groups and individuals, coupled with assurances of anonymity, contribute to respondents feeling very comfortable with the interviewing arrangements. This trust has led to a situation where respondents are willing to reveal personal details about their lives, and to answer questions honestly. The consultations on questions with specialized populations also provided many useful insights into the issues being investigated.

                    "website_data": "Cities With the Most Extreme Weather - WorldAtlas Cities With the Most Extreme Weather Kuwait City, the capital of Kuwait, is the hottest city in the world with daily average temperatures reaching insufferable levels. Humans are social animals. They are brazen adventurers willing to go to any length to seek out the resources necessary to not just survive, but thrive. On the other hand, they can also be lazy and unimaginative, contented with little effort and the creature comforts of civilization. These opposing facts, taken together, can't sufficiently explain why the following metropolises exist. These are cities in areas of the Earth where humankind clearly was not meant to be. Some are quite successful - heralded as exemplar world cities both as destinations and as places to live. In others, residents and visitors still constantly face the threat of death by dehydration, isolation, or exposure These are the cities in the world’s most inhospitable locales: Yakutsk, Russia – World’s Coldest City Yakutsk, located in Russia’s Sakha Republic, has a yearly mean temperature of -8.8º C. That number is deceiving as summer in Yakutsk brings several relatively warm months during which life thaws (though the ground doesn’t – Yakutsk is also the largest city built on permafrost) and temperatures can exceed 30º C. This means that during Yakutsk’s long winter the thermometer often dips below -40º C (the mean lows in December and January are -40.4º C, and -41.5º C respectively), with the coldest temperature ever recorded being -64.4º C. In the winter months, the 269,000 people in Yakutsk (understandably) spend as little time outside as is possible. When they do venture outside, it is not without plenty of insulated clothing. When they need to use a vehicle in the extreme cold, they will keep it running all day to prevent the battery from dying, making steering wheel locks a must. Vehicle exhaust, in addition to factory smogand even the breath of residents creates an ethereal haze that cloaks the city throughout the season. Kuwait City, Kuwait – World’s Hottest City Kuwait City has a metropolitan population of 2.4 million residents who can somehow stand the blistering heat and sandstorms that plague this middle-eastern capital city each year. The city has an annual mean high temperature of 34.3º C, with the months of June, July and August averaging highs between 45-47º C. In 2012, nearby Sulaibya set the record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Asia at 53.8º C (128.8º F). Kuwaitis beat the heat during the summertime by going to the beach, visiting \"Aqua Park\" (the largest water park in the Persian Gulf region\", or hanging out at \"The Avenues\", the largest shopping mall in Kuwait, where you’ll find western chains such as Dolce & Gabbana, Fat Burger, Footlocker, and Texas Roadhouse. Unrelenting heat of thi degree can be deadly. The government imposes an outdoor work ban June through August from 11am to 4pm. However, the ban is rarely enforced for foreign workers who make up nearly a third of Kuwait’s population. Kuwait has also been criticized for systemic abuse of foreign domestic workers, who have reportedly been forced into slavery. Because of this, countries like Indonesia, Nepal, and Sierra Leone have banned its citizens from conducting domestic work in the middle eastern nation. Aswan, Egypt – World’s Driest City Wandering the streets of Aswan, you may come across cafes filled with men smoking Shisha (Middle Eastern water pipe) and playing backgammon, vendors at the open markets mouth-feeding pigeons (to be cooked and prepared in the Egyptian delicacy ‘hammam mahshi’), or even a modern art sculpture park in the middle of a granite quarry, but you are not likely to encounter rain. Aswan is the world’s driest city with less than a millimeter of rainfall annually. Despite a dearth of precipitation, there is access to water. Aswan is located on the Nile and just south of the city lies the world’s largest rock-filled dam (High Dam, or commonly referred to as the Aswan Dam) which creates one of the world’s largest manmade bodies of water, Lake Nasser. The city's name reeks of irony, as \"Aswan\" is an old Nubian word which roughly translates \"too much water\". This isn't intentionally funny, it was named due to the flood cycle of the Nile River More than twenty feet of rain (6,275.6 mm) falls annually on Colombia’s largest port city of Buenaventura. Many neighborhoods on the waterfront of Golfo Tortugas (Turtle Gulf) are primarily comprised of shacks built on stilts. Buildings located away from the bay, around the city’s undulating hills, are an array of weather worn concrete, corrugated steel roofs and awnings, and the occasional crumbling wooden façade, rotted through due to non-stop rain and consistent moisture in the air. Violence, like rain has become a way of life in Buenaventura. As Colombia’s largest port city it is one of South America’s largest hubs for drug trafficking. Former opposing sides of the Colombian civil war (the longest ongoing conflict in the Western Hemisphere) are utilizing the tools of their former trade – drug contacts, arms smuggling, kidnapping, torture, murder – in a different conflict; one between street gangs over territory in Buenaventura. There are three major street gangs in the city: the Urabeños, La Empresa, and the Gaitanistas, all vying for control of the city, with Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel reportedly behind a recent string of murders there as well. The government has attempted a response - armed soldiers patrol the street in some poor neighborhoods. In March of last year, after the release of a report by Human Rights Watch publicizing the everyday horrors occurring in Buenaventura, a government crackdown closed a dozen ‘chop houses’ – buildings where gangs took victims for torture and dismemberment. Yet violence persists - according to a report issued by Human Rights Watch last month, in the year since the federal intervention more than 13,000 residents have been forced to flee their homes due to violence, dismemberments have continued, and disappearances are at the same level they were a year ago. At 29km/h, \"Windy Wellington\" has average wind-speeds 11km/h higher than America’s better known \"Windy City\", Chicago. Wellington is located in the \"Roaring Forties\" or the \"River of Wind\", a meteorological phenomenon which occurs between 40 and 50 latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, hot air from the Equator meets the polar vortex with the only land masses present to break the gusts being the southern tip of South America, and, Wellington (as well as the rest of New Zealand’s South Island). If you bring a wind-breaker, Wellington has a lot to offer (recently named by Lonely Planet as one of the top five cities in the world to visit) – this capital city is home to the \"Beehive\", the location of the Prime Minister’s office and parliament, New Zealand’s National Museum (Te Papa Tongarewa), the Royal New Zealand Ballet and the musical comedy duo \"Flight of the Conchords\". El Alto, Bolivia – World’s Highest City (Altitude) Located 4,150 meters (more than 2 ½ miles) above sea level, the city of El Alto is located in the Altiplano plains region of Bolivia. It started out in the early 20th century as an inconveniently located slum of Bolivia’s administrative capital La Paz, located in the valley below. It has since surpassed La Paz in size and population, and is now the second largest and fastest growing city in Bolivia with 1.18 million residents. Last year the world’s largest urban cable car began operation between El Alto and La Paz, offering commuters a faster alternative to the hour-long, 5 km drive down the treacherous canyon slope. El Alto is the largest Amerindian city in Latin America with 76% of residents of Aymara ethnicity, 9% Quechua, and 15% Mestizo. It has recently been the source of political unrest, with protests organized in the city cutting off the main highway into La Paz. These protests ended up forcing President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada out of office and into exile. It has also served as a base of support for current President Evo Morales, the 1st indigenous president of any South American country. Perth, Australia – World’s Most Isolated City To drive from Perth to the next (relatively) large city in Australia, you would need to make a two day trek through desert climate, along one of the most desolate stretches of road in the world across the Nullarbor (no tree) Plains to Adelaide, South Australia. It is such a feat that there are bumper stickers which commemorate the accomplishment. In the face of such isolation you may expect for Perth to be a culturally-starved backwater. Depending on who you ask, they might agree. However Perth hosts a number of international art, comedy, and music festivals, as well as being the city where both Hugh Jackman and Heath Ledger began their acting careers. Is was home to AC/DC front-man (the late) Bon Scott, and American recording artists Pavement and Bon Iver have both recorded songs about Perth. Whatever you make of the cultural scene in Perth, it is hard to argue its prosperity despite being so far removed from the rest of the world. It is home to the headquarters of the world’s largest diamond mine, boasts a 4.3% unemployment rate, and is routinely named one the best cities in the world to live in. Iquitos, Peru – World’s Least Accessible City The only way to get to the Peruvian ‘Capital of the Amazon’ is by boat or plane. Small ships can reach the city from the Atlantic Ocean, some 3,600 km of travel up the Amazon River, or short flights from Lima, Peru, or Panama City, Panama service the city most days of the week. The city is so remote, very few cars have been transported here, so the city relies on busses, and smaller, motorized rickshaws for transportation. Home to half a million people, Iquitos boasts the bizarre and the divine. If you’re one of the few who gain access to the remote jungle berg, at an Iquitos market you can buy snake oil and live spider monkeys.

However, the laws remained on the statute books and a book was banned again in 2016. Censorship was enacted by a 1929 act of the Irish Free State. History[edit] Following the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 a Committee on Evil Literature was appointed in 1926, reporting to the Department of Justice. The Censorship of Publications Acts of 1929 followed, and established the Censorship of Publications Board. Books could be banned that were considered to be indecent or obscene, as could newspapers whose content relied too much on crime, and works that promoted the \"unnatural\" prevention of conception or that advocated abortion. Ireland's culture at the time was strictly religious. Roman Catholicism —then the religion of 93% of the population — was the fundamental philosophy behind the censorship laws. In 1933, President Éamon de Valera felt that the arts in Ireland were to be encouraged when they observed the \"holiest traditions\", but should be censored when they failed to live up to this ideal. Among the first 13 books to be banned (announced in the Iris Oifigiúil, in May 1930) were Point Counter Point by Aldous Huxley, The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall and several books on sex and marriage by Margaret Sanger and Marie Stopes. From 1930 onwards, many books of undoubted literary merit, as well as serious books on reproductive issues and sexual health, were banned. Banned books were listed in the Government publication Iris Oifigiúil, and the list, or a selection, was usually published in the Irish Times. Among Irish books or authors whose book(s) were banned were Liam O'Flaherty (1930), Seán Ó Faoláin (1932), Francis Stuart (1939), Oliver St. John Gogarty (1942), The Tailor and Ansty by Eric Cross (1942), The Gadfly by Ethel Lilian Voynich (1947), Maura Laverty (1948), Walter Macken (1948), Frank O'Connor (1951), Sam Hanna Bell (1952), Brian Cleeve (1952), Benedict Kiely (1954). The Censorship of Publications Act, 1967, limited the period of prohibition orders of books to twelve years (although books released after this period could be banned again by the Board). The act thus allowed the immediate sale of over 5,000 previously banned books. Strict censorship has since ceased, and virtually all books banned have been unbanned. A 2007 era listing of banned books showed that none had been banned since 1998. Contrary to popular belief, James Joyce's Ulysses was technically never banned in Ireland, but this was because it was never imported and offered for sale, for fear of such a ban and its attendant costs. In 1942 Senator Sir John Keane told the Seanad that 1,600 books had been banned since independence in 1922. He quoted examples of supposed indecency from several books to ridicule the law; prudishly, his extracts were not reported verbatim, but as: \"[The Senator quoted from the book.]\". Books containing references to terrorism or which could be considered slander under Irish law can still be banned – one will not be prosecuted for owning or importing them, but their sale is prohibited. This covers books such as The Committee: Political Assassination in Northern Ireland, which has even been pulled from Amazon.com due to its content. However, importing this book and its sale second-hand are still legal. There are instances of books which were at one time banned in Ireland subsequently not only having the ban overturned but the books in question becoming required reading on the Leaving Certificate syllabus, e.g., Salinger's Catcher in the Rye (banned in October 1951). The Catholic Index was underpinned by Canon law until it was abolished in 1966. Thereafter Irish censorship of books declined markedly. In 2010 it was announced that, as the last book had been banned in 1998, no books were currently banned in Ireland as the 12-year limitation had run out on all existing bans. In March 2016 the Irish Censorship board issued its first ban in 18 years. The book The Raped Little Runaway by Jean Martin was deemed \"indecent or obscene\" by the board. Justifying its decision, the board pointed to the several instances of rape of a minor in the book. List of banned books[edit] Some of the banned books include: Title Author Type Notes Droll Stories (1832–37) Honoré de Balzac Banned for obscene material of a sexual nature in 1953, but lifted 1967. Brave New World (1932) Aldous Huxley Novel Banned in Ireland in 1932, due to alleged references of sexual promiscuity. Catcher in the Rye (1951) J. D. Salinger Novel Banned in October 1951. Borstal Boy (1958) Brendan Behan Autobiographical Novel Banned in 1958. The Irish Censorship of Publications Board was not obliged to reveal its reason but it is believed that it was rejected for its critique of Irish republicanism and the Catholic Church, and its depiction of adolescent sexuality. The Country Girls (1960) Edna O'Brien Novel Banned by Ireland's censorship board in 1960 for its explicit sexual content. The Lonely Girl (1962) Edna O'Brien Novel Banned in 1962 after Archbishop John Charles McQuaid complained personally to Justice Minister Charles Haughey that it \"was particularly bad\".

The Three Laws of Robotics (often shortened to The Three Laws or Asimov's Laws) are a set of rules devised by science fiction author Isaac Asimov, which were to be followed by robots in several of his stories. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story \"Runaround\" (included in the 1950 collection I, Robot), although similar restrictions had been implied in earlier stories. The Laws[edit] The Three Laws, presented to be from the fictional \"Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.\", are: The First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. The Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. The Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Use in fiction[edit] The Three Laws form an organizing principle and unifying theme for Asimov's robot-based fiction, appearing in his Robot series, the stories linked to it, and in his (initially pseudonymous) Lucky Starr series of young-adult fiction. The Laws are incorporated into almost all of the positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres. The original laws have been altered and elaborated on by Asimov and other authors. Asimov himself made slight modifications to the first three in subsequent works to further develop how robots would interact with humans and each other. In later fiction where robots had taken responsibility for government of whole planets and human civilizations, Asimov also added a fourth, or zeroth law, to precede the others. The Three Laws, and the Zeroth, have pervaded science fiction and are referred to in many books, films, and other media. They have also influenced thought on the ethics of artificial intelligence. History[edit] In The Rest of the Robots, published in 1964, Isaac Asimov noted that when he began writing in 1940 he felt that \"one of the stock plots of science fiction was ... robots were created and destroyed their creator. Knowledge has its dangers, yes, but is the response to be a retreat from knowledge? Or is knowledge to be used as itself a barrier to the dangers it brings?\" He decided that in his stories a robot would not \"turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of Faust.\" On May 3, 1939, Asimov attended a meeting of the Queens (New York) Science Fiction Society where he met Earl and Otto Binder who had recently published a short story \"I, Robot\" featuring a sympathetic robot named Adam Link who was misunderstood and motivated by love and honor. (This was the first of a series of ten stories; the next year \"Adam Link's Vengeance\" (1940) featured Adam thinking \"A robot must never kill a human, of his own free will.\") Asimov admired the story. Three days later Asimov began writing \"my own story of a sympathetic and noble robot\", his 14th story. Thirteen days later he took \"Robbie\" to John W. Campbell the editor of Astounding Science-Fiction. Campbell rejected it, claiming that it bore too strong a resemblance to Lester del Rey's \"Helen O'Loy\", published in December 1938—the story of a robot that is so much like a person that she falls in love with her creator and becomes his ideal wife. Frederik Pohl published the story under the title “Strange Playfellow” in Super Science Stories September 1940. Asimov attributes the Three Laws to John W. Campbell, from a conversation that took place on 23 December 1940. Campbell claimed that Asimov had the Three Laws already in his mind and that they simply needed to be stated explicitly. Several years later Asimov's friend Randall Garrett attributed the Laws to a symbiotic partnership between the two men—a suggestion that Asimov adopted enthusiastically. According to his autobiographical writings, Asimov included the First Law's \"inaction\" clause because of Arthur Hugh Clough's poem \"The Latest Decalogue\" (text in Wikisource), which includes the satirical lines \"Thou shalt not kill, but needst not strive / officiously to keep alive\". Although Asimov pins the creation of the Three Laws on one particular date, their appearance in his literature happened over a period. He wrote two robot stories with no explicit mention of the Laws, \"Robbie\" and \"Reason\". He assumed, however, that robots would have certain inherent safeguards. \"Liar!\", his third robot story, makes the first mention of the First Law but not the other two. All three laws finally appeared together in \"Runaround\". When these stories and several others were compiled in the anthology I, Robot, \"Reason\" and \"Robbie\" were updated to acknowledge all the Three Laws, though the material Asimov added to \"Reason\" is not entirely consistent with the Three Laws as he described them elsewhere. In particular the idea of a robot protecting human lives when it does not believe those humans truly exist is at odds with Elijah Baley's reasoning, as described below. During the 1950s Asimov wrote a series of science fiction novels expressly intended for young-adult audiences. Originally his publisher expected that the novels could be adapted into a long-running television series, something like The Lone Ranger had been for radio. Fearing that his stories would be adapted into the \"uniformly awful\" programming he saw flooding the television channels Asimov decided to publish the Lucky Starr books under the pseudonym \"Paul French\". When plans for the television series fell through, Asimov decided to abandon the pretence; he brought the Three Laws into Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter, noting that this \"was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for even the most casual reader\". In his short story \"Evidence\" Asimov lets his recurring character Dr. Susan Calvin expound a moral basis behind the Three Laws. Calvin points out that human beings are typically expected to refrain from harming other human beings (except in times of extreme duress like war, or to save a greater number) and this is equivalent to a robot's First Law. Likewise, according to Calvin, society expects individuals to obey instructions from recognized authorities such as doctors, teachers and so forth which equals the Second Law of Robotics. Finally humans are typically expected to avoid harming themselves which is the Third Law for a robot. The plot of \"Evidence\" revolves around the question of telling a human being apart from a robot constructed to appear human. Calvin reasons that if such an individual obeys the Three Laws he may be a robot or simply \"a very good man\". Another character then asks Calvin if robots are very different from human beings after all. She replies, \"Worlds different. Robots are essentially decent.\" Asimov later wrote that he should not be praised for creating the Laws, because they are \"obvious from the start, and everyone is aware of them subliminally. The Laws just never happened to be put into brief sentences until I managed to do the job. The Laws apply, as a matter of course, to every tool that human beings use\", and \"analogues of the Laws are implicit in the design of almost all tools, robotic or not\": Law 1: A tool must not be unsafe to use. Hammers have handles and screwdrivers have hilts to help increase grip. It is of course possible for a person to injure himself with one of these tools, but that injury would only be due to his incompetence, not the design of the tool. Law 2: A tool must perform its function efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason ground-fault circuit interrupters exist. Any running tool will have its power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the neutral wire, and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount. Law 3: A tool must remain intact during its use unless its destruction is required for its use or for safety. For example, Dremel disks are designed to be as tough as possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway). Asimov believed that, ideally, humans would also follow the Laws: I have my answer ready whenever someone asks me if I think that my Three Laws of Robotics will actually be used to govern the behavior of robots, once they become versatile and flexible enough to be able to choose among different courses of behavior. My answer is, \"Yes, the Three Laws are the only way in which rational human beings can deal with robots—or with anything else.\" —But when I say that, I always remember (sadly) that human beings are not always rational. Asimov stated in a 1986 interview on the Manhattan public access show Conversations with Harold Hudson Channer with Harold Channer with guest co-host Marilyn vos Savant, \"It's a little humbling to think that, what is most likely to survive of everything I've said... After all, I've published now... I've published now at least 20 million words. I'll have to figure it out, maybe even more. But of all those millions of words that I've published, I am convinced that 100 years from now only 60 of them will survive. The 60 that make up the Three Laws of Robotics.\" Alterations[edit] By Asimov[edit] Asimov's stories test his Three Laws in a wide variety of circumstances leading to proposals and rejection of modifications. Science fiction scholar James Gunn writes in 1982, \"The Asimov robot stories as a whole may respond best to an analysis on this basis: the ambiguity in the Three Laws and the ways in which Asimov played twenty-nine variations upon a theme\". While the original set of Laws provided inspirations for many stories, Asimov introduced modified versions from time to time. First Law modified[edit] In \"Little Lost Robot\" several NS-2, or \"Nestor\", robots are created with only part of the First Law. It reads: 1. A robot may not harm a human being. This modification is motivated by a practical difficulty as robots have to work alongside human beings who are exposed to low doses of radiation. Because their positronic brains are highly sensitive to gamma rays the robots are rendered inoperable by doses reasonably safe for humans. The robots are being destroyed attempting to rescue the humans who are in no actual danger but \"might forget to leave\" the irradiated area within the exposure time limit. Removing the First Law's \"inaction\" clause solves this problem but creates the possibility of an even greater one: a robot could initiate an action that would harm a human (dropping a heavy weight and failing to catch it is the example given in the text), knowing that it was capable of preventing the harm and then decide not to do so. Gaia is a planet with collective intelligence in the Foundation series which adopts a law similar to the First Law, and the Zeroth Law, as its philosophy: Gaia may not harm life or allow life to come to harm. Zeroth Law added[edit] Asimov once added a \"Zeroth Law\"—so named to continue the pattern where lower-numbered laws supersede the higher-numbered laws—stating that a robot must not harm humanity. The robotic character R. Daneel Olivaw was the first to give the Zeroth Law a name in the novel Robots and Empire; however, the character Susan Calvin articulates the concept in the short story \"The Evitable Conflict\". In the final scenes of the novel Robots and Empire, R. Giskard Reventlov is the first robot to act according to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is telepathic, like the robot Herbie in the short story \"Liar!\", and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of \"harm\" than most robots can grasp. However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings if he can do so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard's brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure metacognition. Although he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice will turn out to be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law.[citation needed] Daneel originally formulated the Zeroth Law in both the novel Foundation and Earth (1986) and the subsequent novel Prelude to Foundation (1988): A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm. A condition stating that the Zeroth Law must not be broken was added to the original Three Laws, although Asimov recognized the difficulty such a law would pose in practice. Asimov's novel Foundation and Earth contains the following passage: Trevize frowned. \"How do you decide what is injurious, or not injurious, to humanity as a whole?\" \"Precisely, sir,\" said Daneel. \"In theory, the Zeroth Law was the answer to our problems. In practice, we could never decide. A human being is a concrete object. Injury to a person can be estimated and judged. Humanity is an abstraction.\" A translator incorporated the concept of the Zeroth Law into one of Asimov's novels before Asimov himself made the law explicit. Near the climax of The Caves of Steel, Elijah Baley makes a bitter comment to himself thinking that the First Law forbids a robot from harming a human being. He determines that it must be so unless the robot is clever enough to comprehend that its actions are for humankind's long-term good. In Jacques Brécard's 1956 French translation entitled Les Cavernes d'acier Baley's thoughts emerge in a slightly different way: A robot may not harm a human being, unless he finds a way to prove that ultimately the harm done would benefit humanity in general! Removal of the Three Laws[edit] Three times during his writing career, Asimov portrayed robots that disregard the Three Laws entirely. The first case was a short-short story entitled \"First Law\" and is often considered an insignificant \"tall tale\" or even apocryphal. On the other hand, the short story \"Cal\" (from the collection Gold), told by a first-person robot narrator, features a robot who disregards the Three Laws because he has found something far more important—he wants to be a writer. Humorous, partly autobiographical and unusually experimental in style, \"Cal\" has been regarded as one of Gold's strongest stories. The third is a short story entitled \"Sally\" in which cars fitted with positronic brains are apparently able to harm and kill humans in disregard of the First Law. However, aside from the positronic brain concept, this story does not refer to other robot stories and may not be set in the same continuity. The title story of the Robot Dreams collection portrays LVX-1, or \"Elvex\", a robot who enters a state of unconsciousness and dreams thanks to the unusual fractal construction of his positronic brain. In his dream the first two Laws are absent and the Third Law reads \"A robot must protect its own existence\". Asimov took varying positions on whether the Laws were optional: although in his first writings they were simply carefully engineered safeguards, in later stories Asimov stated that they were an inalienable part of the mathematical foundation underlying the positronic brain. Without the basic theory of the Three Laws the fictional scientists of Asimov's universe would be unable to design a workable brain unit. This is historically consistent: the occasions where roboticists modify the Laws generally occur early within the stories' chronology and at a time when there is less existing work to be re-done. In \"Little Lost Robot\" Susan Calvin considers modifying the Laws to be a terrible idea, although possible, while centuries later Dr. Gerrigel in The Caves of Steel believes it to require a century just to redevelop the positronic brain theory from scratch. The character Dr. Gerrigel uses the term \"Asenion\" to describe robots programmed with the Three Laws. The robots in Asimov's stories, being Asenion robots, are incapable of knowingly violating the Three Laws but, in principle, a robot in science fiction or in the real world could be non-Asenion. \"Asenion\" is a misspelling of the name Asimov which was made by an editor of the magazine Planet Stories. Asimov used this obscure variation to insert himself into The Caves of Steel just like he referred to himself as \"Azimuth or, possibly, Asymptote\" in Thiotimoline to the Stars, in much the same way that Vladimir Nabokov appeared in Lolita anagrammatically disguised as \"Vivian Darkbloom\". Characters within the stories often point out that the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot's mind, are not the written versions usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot's entire developing consciousness is based. This concept is largely fuzzy and unclear in earlier stories depicting very rudimentary robots who are only programmed to comprehend basic physical tasks, where the Three Laws act as an overarching safeguard, but by the era of The Caves of Steel featuring robots with human or beyond-human intelligence the Three Laws have become the underlying basic ethical worldview that determines the actions of all robots. By other authors[edit] Roger MacBride Allen's trilogy[edit] In the 1990s, Roger MacBride Allen wrote a trilogy which was set within Asimov's fictional universe. Each title has the prefix \"Isaac Asimov's\" as Asimov had approved Allen's outline before his death.[citation needed] These three books, Caliban, Inferno and Utopia, introduce a new set of the Three Laws. The so-called New Laws are similar to Asimov's originals with the following differences: the First Law is modified to remove the \"inaction\" clause, the same modification made in \"Little Lost Robot\"; the Second Law is modified to require cooperation instead of obedience; the Third Law is modified so it is no longer superseded by the Second (i.e., a \"New Law\" robot cannot be ordered to destroy itself); finally, Allen adds a Fourth Law which instructs the robot to do \"whatever it likes\" so long as this does not conflict with the first three laws. The philosophy behind these changes is that \"New Law\" robots should be partners rather than slaves to humanity, according to Fredda Leving, who designed these New Law Robots. According to the first book's introduction, Allen devised the New Laws in discussion with Asimov himself. However, the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction says that \"With permission from Asimov, Allen rethought the Three Laws and developed a new set.\" Jack Williamson's \"With Folded Hands\"[edit] Jack Williamson's novelette \"With Folded Hands\" (1947), later rewritten as the novel The Humanoids, deals with robot servants whose prime directive is \"To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm\". While Asimov's robotic laws are meant to protect humans from harm, the robots in Williamson's story have taken these instructions to the extreme; they protect humans from everything, including unhappiness, stress, unhealthy lifestyle and all actions that could be potentially dangerous. All that is left for humans to do is to sit with folded hands. Foundation sequel trilogy[edit] In the officially licensed Foundation sequels Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos and Foundation's Triumph (by Gregory Benford, Greg Bear and David Brin respectively) the future Galactic Empire is seen to be controlled by a conspiracy of humaniform robots who follow the Zeroth Law and are led by R. Daneel Olivaw. The Laws of Robotics are portrayed as something akin to a human religion, and referred to in the language of the Protestant Reformation, with the set of laws containing the Zeroth Law known as the \"Giskardian Reformation\" to the original \"Calvinian Orthodoxy\" of the Three Laws. Zeroth-Law robots under the control of R. Daneel Olivaw are seen continually struggling with \"First Law\" robots who deny the existence of the Zeroth Law, promoting agendas different from Daneel's. Some of these agendas are based on the first clause of the First Law (\"A robot may not injure a human being...\") advocating strict non-interference in human politics to avoid unwittingly causing harm. Others are based on the second clause (\"...or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm\") claiming that robots should openly become a dictatorial government to protect humans from all potential conflict or disaster. Daneel also comes into conflict with a robot known as R. Lodovic Trema whose positronic brain was infected by a rogue AI — specifically, a simulation of the long-dead Voltaire — which consequently frees Trema from the Three Laws. Trema comes to believe that humanity should be free to choose its own future. Furthermore, a small group of robots claims that the Zeroth Law of Robotics itself implies a higher Minus One Law of Robotics: A robot may not harm sentience or, through inaction, allow sentience to come to harm. They therefore claim that it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and extraterrestrial sentient life for the benefit of humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel's Zeroth Law — though Foundation's Triumph hints that these robotic factions remain active as fringe groups up to the time of the novel Foundation. These novels take place in a future dictated by Asimov to be free of obvious robot presence and surmise that R. Daneel's secret influence on history through the millennia has prevented both the rediscovery of positronic brain technology and the opportunity to work on sophisticated intelligent machines. This lack of rediscovery and lack of opportunity makes certain that the superior physical and intellectual power wielded by intelligent machines remains squarely in the possession of robots obedient to some form of the Three Laws. That R. Daneel is not entirely successful at this becomes clear in a brief period when scientists on Trantor develop \"tiktoks\" — simplistic programmable machines akin to real–life modern robots and therefore lacking the Three Laws. The robot conspirators see the Trantorian tiktoks as a massive threat to social stability, and their plan to eliminate the tiktok threat forms much of the plot of Foundation's Fear. In Foundation's Triumph different robot factions interpret the Laws in a wide variety of ways, seemingly ringing every possible permutation upon the Three Laws' ambiguities. Robot Mystery series[edit] Set between The Robots of Dawn and Robots and Empire, Mark W. Tiedemann's Robot Mystery trilogy updates the Robot–Foundation saga with robotic minds housed in computer mainframes rather than humanoid bodies.[clarification needed] The 2002 Aurora novel has robotic characters debating the moral implications of harming cyborg lifeforms who are part artificial and part biological. One should not neglect Asimov's own creations in these areas such as the Solarian \"viewing\" technology and the machines of The Evitable Conflict originals that Tiedemann acknowledges. Aurora, for example, terms the Machines \"the first RIs, really\". In addition the Robot Mystery series addresses the problem of nanotechnology: building a positronic brain capable of reproducing human cognitive processes requires a high degree of miniaturization, yet Asimov's stories largely overlook the effects this miniaturization would have in other fields of technology. For example, the police department card-readers in The Caves of Steel have a capacity of only a few kilobytes per square centimeter of storage medium. Aurora, in particular, presents a sequence of historical developments which explains the lack of nanotechnology — a partial retcon, in a sense, of Asimov's timeline. Randall Munroe[edit] Randall Munroe has discussed the Three Laws in various instances, but possibly most directly by one of his comics entitled The Three Laws of Robotics which imagines the consequences of every distinct ordering of the existing three laws. Additional laws[edit] Authors other than Asimov have often created extra laws. The 1974 Lyuben Dilov novel, Icarus's Way (a.k.a., The Trip of Icarus) introduced a Fourth Law of robotics: \"A robot must establish its identity as a robot in all cases.\" Dilov gives reasons for the fourth safeguard in this way: \"The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings...\" A fifth law was introduced by Nikola Kesarovski in his short story \"The Fifth Law of Robotics\". This fifth law says: \"A robot must know it is a robot.\" The plot revolves around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers that the victim was killed by a hug from a humaniform robot that did not establish for itself that it was a robot. The story was reviewed by Valentin D. Ivanov in SFF review webzine The Portal. For the 1986 tribute anthology, Foundation's Friends, Harry Harrison wrote a story entitled, \"The Fourth Law of Robotics\". This Fourth Law states: \"A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law.\" In 2013 Hutan Ashrafian proposed an additional law that considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law. This sixth law states: \"All robots endowed with comparable human reason and conscience should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\" Ambiguities and loopholes[edit] Unknowing breach of the laws[edit] In The Naked Sun, Elijah Baley points out that the Laws had been deliberately misrepresented because robots could unknowingly break any of them. He restated the first law as \"A robot may do nothing that, to its knowledge, will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, knowingly allow a human being to come to harm.\" This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he points out that a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being. The Naked Sun complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet. Baley furthermore proposes that the Solarians may one day use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant. This possibility is referenced in Foundation and Earth where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human. (The novel takes place thousands of years after The Naked Sun, and the Solarians have long since modified themselves from normal humans to hermaphroditic telepaths with extended brains and specialized organs) Similarly, in Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn Bigman attempts to speak with a Sirian robot about possible damage to the Solar System population from its actions, but it appears unaware of the data and programmed to ignore attempts to teach it about the matter. Ambiguities resulting from lack of definition[edit] The Laws of Robotics presume that the terms \"human being\" and \"robot\" are understood and well defined. In some stories this presumption is overturned. Definition of \"human being\"[edit] The Solarians create robots with the Three Laws but with a warped meaning of \"human\". Solarian robots are told that only people speaking with a Solarian accent are human. This enables their robots to have no ethical dilemma in harming non-Solarian human beings (and they are specifically programmed to do so). By the time period of Foundation and Earth it is revealed that the Solarians have genetically modified themselves into a distinct species from humanity—becoming hermaphroditic and psychokinetic and containing biological organs capable of individually powering and controlling whole complexes of robots. The robots of Solaria thus respected the Three Laws only with regard to the \"humans\" of Solaria. It is unclear whether all the robots had such definitions, since only the overseer and guardian robots were shown explicitly to have them. In \"Robots and Empire\", the lower class robots were instructed by their overseer about whether certain creatures are human or not. Asimov addresses the problem of humanoid robots (\"androids\" in later parlance) several times. The novel Robots and Empire and the short stories \"Evidence\" and \"The Tercentenary Incident\" describe robots crafted to fool people into believing that the robots are human. On the other hand, \"The Bicentennial Man\" and \"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him\" explore how the robots may change their interpretation of the Laws as they grow more sophisticated. Gwendoline Butler writes in A Coffin for the Canary \"Perhaps we are robots. Robots acting out the last Law of Robotics... To tend towards the human.\" In The Robots of Dawn, Elijah Baley points out that the use of humaniform robots as the first wave of settlers on new Spacer worlds may lead to the robots seeing themselves as the true humans, and deciding to keep the worlds for themselves rather than allow the Spacers to settle there. \"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him\", which Asimov intended to be the \"ultimate\" probe into the Laws' subtleties, finally uses the Three Laws to conjure up the very \"Frankenstein\" scenario they were invented to prevent. It takes as its concept the growing development of robots that mimic non-human living things and given programs that mimic simple animal behaviours which do not require the Three Laws. The presence of a whole range of robotic life that serves the same purpose as organic life ends with two humanoid robots, George Nine and George Ten, concluding that organic life is an unnecessary requirement for a truly logical and self-consistent definition of \"humanity\", and that since they are the most advanced thinking beings on the planet, they are therefore the only two true humans alive and the Three Laws only apply to themselves. The story ends on a sinister note as the two robots enter hibernation and await a time when they will conquer the Earth and subjugate biological humans to themselves, an outcome they consider an inevitable result of the \"Three Laws of Humanics\". This story does not fit within the overall sweep of the Robot and Foundation series; if the George robots did take over Earth some time after the story closes, the later stories would be either redundant or impossible. Contradictions of this sort among Asimov's fiction works have led scholars to regard the Robot stories as more like \"the Scandinavian sagas or the Greek legends\" than a unified whole. Indeed, Asimov describes \"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him\" and \"Bicentennial Man\" as two opposite, parallel futures for robots that obviate the Three Laws as robots come to consider themselves to be humans: one portraying this in a positive light with a robot joining human society, one portraying this in a negative light with robots supplanting humans. Both are to be considered alternatives to the possibility of a robot society that continues to be driven by the Three Laws as portrayed in the Foundation series.[according to whom?] The Positronic Man, the novelization of The Bicentennial Man, Asimov and his co-writer Robert Silverberg imply that in the future where Andrew Martin exists his influence causes humanity to abandon the idea of independent, sentient humanlike robots entirely, creating an utterly different future from that of Foundation.[according to whom?] In Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn, a novel unrelated to the Robot series but featuring robots programmed with the Three Laws, John Bigman Jones is almost killed by a Sirian robot on orders of its master. The society of Sirius is eugenically bred to be uniformly tall and similar in appearance, and as such, said master is able to convince the robot that the much shorter Bigman, is, in fact, not a human being. Definition of \"robot\"[edit] As noted in \"The Fifth Law of Robotics\" by Nikola Kesarovski, \"A robot must know it is a robot\": it is presumed that a robot has a definition of the term or a means to apply it to its own actions. Kesarovski played with this idea in writing about a robot that could kill a human being because it did not understand that it was a robot, and therefore did not apply the Laws of Robotics to its actions. Resolving conflicts among the laws[edit] Advanced robots in fiction are typically programmed to handle the Three Laws in a sophisticated manner. In many stories, such as \"Runaround\" by Asimov, the potential and severity of all actions are weighed and a robot will break the laws as little as possible rather than do nothing at all. For example, the First Law may forbid a robot from functioning as a surgeon, as that act may cause damage to a human; however, Asimov's stories eventually included robot surgeons (\"The Bicentennial Man\" being a notable example). When robots are sophisticated enough to weigh alternatives, a robot may be programmed to accept the necessity of inflicting damage during surgery in order to prevent the greater harm that would result if the surgery were not carried out, or was carried out by a more fallible human surgeon. In \"Evidence\" Susan Calvin points out that a robot may even act as a prosecuting attorney because in the American justice system it is the jury which decides guilt or innocence, the judge who decides the sentence, and the executioner who carries through capital punishment. Asimov's Three Laws-obeying robots (Asenion robots) can experience irreversible mental collapse if they are forced into situations where they cannot obey the First Law, or if they discover they have unknowingly violated it. The first example of this failure mode occurs in the story \"Liar!\", which introduced the First Law itself, and introduces failure by dilemma—in this case the robot will hurt humans if he tells them something and hurt them if he does not. This failure mode, which often ruins the positronic brain beyond repair, plays a significant role in Asimov's SF-mystery novel The Naked Sun. Here Daneel describes activities contrary to one of the laws, but in support of another, as overloading some circuits in a robot's brain—the equivalent sensation to pain in humans. The example he uses is forcefully ordering a robot to do a task outside its normal parameters, one that it has been ordered to forgo in favor of a robot specialized to that task. In The Robots of Dawn, it is stated that more advanced robots are built capable of determining which action is more harmful, and even choosing at random if the alternatives are equally bad. As such, a robot is capable of taking an action which can be interpreted as following the First Law, thus avoiding a mental collapse. The whole plot of the story revolves around a robot which apparently was destroyed by such a mental collapse, and since his designer and creator refused to share the basic theory with others, he is, by definition, the only person capable of circumventing the safeguards and forcing the robot into a brain-destroying paradox. In Robots and Empire, Daneel states it's very unpleasant for him when making the proper decision takes too long (in robot terms), and he cannot imagine being without the Laws at all except to the extent of it being similar to that unpleasant sensation, only permanent. Applications to future technology[edit] See also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence, Ethics of artificial intelligence, and Friendly artificial intelligence ASIMO was an advanced humanoid robot developed by Honda. Shown here at Expo 2005. Robots and artificial intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise a means to do so. Robots already exist (for example, a Roomba) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints. However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation. In a 2007 guest editorial in the journal Science on the topic of \"Robot Ethics\", SF author Robert J. Sawyer argues that since the U.S. military is a major source of funding for robotic research (and already uses armed unmanned aerial vehicles to kill enemies) it is unlikely such laws would be built into their designs. In a separate essay, Sawyer generalizes this argument to cover other industries stating: The development of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards — especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry. Not one of these has said from the outset that fundamental safeguards are necessary, every one of them has resisted externally imposed safeguards, and none has accepted an absolute edict against ever causing harm to humans.) David Langford has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws: A robot will not harm authorized Government personnel but will terminate intruders with extreme prejudice. A robot will obey the orders of authorized personnel except where such orders conflict with the Third Law. A robot will guard its own existence with lethal antipersonnel weaponry, because a robot is bloody expensive. Roger Clarke (aka Rodger Clarke) wrote a pair of papers analyzing the complications in implementing these laws in the event that systems were someday capable of employing them. He argued \"Asimov's Laws of Robotics have been a very successful literary device. Perhaps ironically, or perhaps because it was artistically appropriate, the sum of Asimov's stories disprove the contention that he began with: It is not possible to reliably constrain the behaviour of robots by devising and applying a set of rules.\" On the other hand, Asimov's later novels The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire and Foundation and Earth imply that the robots inflicted their worst long-term harm by obeying the Three Laws perfectly well, thereby depriving humanity of inventive or risk-taking behaviour. In March 2007 the South Korean government announced that later in the year it would issue a \"Robot Ethics Charter\" setting standards for both users and manufacturers. According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov's Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics. The futurist Hans Moravec (a prominent figure in the transhumanist movement) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to \"corporate intelligences\" — the corporations driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future. In contrast, the David Brin novel Foundation's Triumph (1999) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence: Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play. Brin even portrays R. Daneel Olivaw worrying that, should robots continue to reproduce themselves, the Three Laws would become an evolutionary handicap and natural selection would sweep the Laws away — Asimov's careful foundation undone by evolutionary computation. Although the robots would not be evolving through design instead of mutation because the robots would have to follow the Three Laws while designing and the prevalence of the laws would be ensured, design flaws or construction errors could functionally take the place of biological mutation. In the July/August 2009 issue of IEEE Intelligent Systems, Robin Murphy (Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M) and David D. Woods (director of the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State) proposed \"The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics\" as a way to stimulate discussion about the role of responsibility and authority when designing not only a single robotic platform but the larger system in which the platform operates. The laws are as follows: A human may not deploy a robot without the human-robot work system meeting the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics. A robot must respond to humans as appropriate for their roles. A robot must be endowed with sufficient situated autonomy to protect its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer of control which does not conflict with the First and Second Laws. Woods said, \"Our laws are a little more realistic, and therefore a little more boring” and that \"The philosophy has been, ‘sure, people make mistakes, but robots will be better – a perfect version of ourselves’. We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways.\" In early 2011, the UK published what is now considered the first national-level AI softlaw, which consisted largely of a revised set of 5 laws, the first 3 of which updated Asimov's. These laws ere published with commentary, by the EPSRC/AHRC working group in 2010: Robots are multi-use tools. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans, except in the interests of national security. Humans, not Robots, are responsible agents. Robots should be designed and operated as far as practicable to comply with existing laws, fundamental rights and freedoms, including privacy. Robots are products. They should be designed using processes which assure their safety and security. Robots are manufactured artefacts. They should not be designed in a deceptive way to exploit vulnerable users; instead their machine nature should be transparent. The person with legal responsibility for a robot should be attributed. Other occurrences in media[edit] Main article: The Three Laws of Robotics in popular culture Asimov himself believed that his Three Laws became the basis for a new view of robots which moved beyond the \"Frankenstein complex\".[citation needed] His view that robots are more than mechanical monsters eventually spread throughout science fiction.[according to whom?] Stories written by other authors have depicted robots as if they obeyed the Three Laws but tradition dictates that only Asimov could quote the Laws explicitly.[according to whom?] Asimov believed the Three Laws helped foster the rise of stories in which robots are \"lovable\" – Star Wars being his favorite example. Where the laws are quoted verbatim, such as in the Buck Rogers in the 25th Century episode \"Shgoratchx!\", it is not uncommon for Asimov to be mentioned in the same dialogue as can also be seen in the Aaron Stone pilot where an android states that it functions under Asimov's Three Laws. However, the 1960s German TV series Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion (Space Patrol – the Fantastic Adventures of Space Ship Orion) bases episode three titled \"Hüter des Gesetzes\" (\"Guardians of the Law\") on Asimov's Three Laws without mentioning the source. References to the Three Laws have appeared in popular music (\"Robot\" from Hawkwind's 1979 album PXR5), cinema (Repo Man, Aliens, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence), cartoon series (The Simpsons), anime (Eve no Jikan), tabletop role-playing games (Paranoia) and webcomics (Piled Higher and Deeper and Freefall). The Three Laws in film[edit] Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet (1956) has a hierarchical command structure which keeps him from harming humans, even when ordered to do so, as such orders cause a conflict and lock-up very much in the manner of Asimov's robots. Robby is one of the first cinematic depictions of a robot with internal safeguards put in place in this fashion. Asimov was delighted with Robby and noted that Robby appeared to be programmed to follow his Three Laws. NDR-114 explaining the Three Laws Isaac Asimov's works have been adapted for cinema several times with varying degrees of critical and commercial success. Some of the more notable attempts have involved his \"Robot\" stories, including the Three Laws. The film Bicentennial Man (1999) features Robin Williams as the Three Laws robot NDR-114 (the serial number is partially a reference to Stanley Kubrick's signature numeral). Williams recites the Three Laws to his employers, the Martin family, aided by a holographic projection. The film only loosely follows the original story. Harlan Ellison's proposed screenplay for I, Robot began by introducing the Three Laws, and issues growing from the Three Laws form a large part of the screenplay's plot development. Due to various complications in the Hollywood moviemaking system, to which Ellison's introduction devotes much invective, his screenplay was never filmed. In the 1986 movie Aliens, after the android Bishop accidentally cuts himself, he attempts to reassure Ripley by stating that: \"It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being\". The plot of the film released in 2004 under the name, I, Robot is \"suggested by\" Asimov's robot fiction stories and advertising for the film included a trailer featuring the Three Laws followed by the aphorism, \"Rules were made to be broken\". The film opens with a recitation of the Three Laws and explores the implications of the Zeroth Law as a logical extrapolation. The major conflict of the film comes from a computer artificial intelligence reaching the conclusion that humanity is incapable of taking care of itself. The 2019 Netflix original series Better than Us includes the 3 laws in the opening of episode 1. Criticisms[edit] Philosopher James H. Moor says that if applied thoroughly they would produce unexpected results. He gives the example of a robot roaming the world trying to prevent harm from befalling human beings.

                        "We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways.\" In early 2011, the UK published what is now considered the first national-level AI softlaw, which consisted largely of a revised set of 5 laws, the first 3 of which updated Asimov's",
                        "Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints",
                        "Robots and artificial intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise a means to do so",
                        "The Three Laws of Robotics (often shortened to The Three Laws or Asimov's Laws) are a set of rules devised by science fiction author Isaac Asimov, which were to be followed by robots in several of his stories",
                        "As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law.\" In 2013 Hutan Ashrafian proposed an additional law that considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law",
                        "The so-called New Laws are similar to Asimov's originals with the following differences: the First Law is modified to remove the \"inaction\" clause, the same modification made in \"Little Lost Robot\"; the Second Law is modified to require cooperation instead of obedience; the Third Law is modified so it is no longer superseded by the Second (i.e., a \"New Law\" robot cannot be ordered to destroy itself); finally, Allen adds a Fourth Law which instructs the robot to do \"whatever it likes\" so long as this does not conflict with the first three laws",
                        "According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov's Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics",
                        "Asimov believed that, ideally, humans would also follow the Laws: I have my answer ready whenever someone asks me if I think that my Three Laws of Robotics will actually be used to govern the behavior of robots, once they become versatile and flexible enough to be able to choose among different courses of behavior",
                        "The Laws[edit] The Three Laws, presented to be from the fictional \"Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.\", are: The First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm",
                        "Characters within the stories often point out that the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot's mind, are not the written versions usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot's entire developing consciousness is based"

Here is the law in a nutshell: it is not illegal to drive in the UK without shoes on and the same applies for wearing flip flops - there is a catch though...it is not illegal to drive in the UK without shoes onYou can get behind the wheel of a vehicle barefoot or while wearing flip flops, provided you are able to operate the controls safely. If you do so with wet feet, for example, you might be putting yourself, your passengers and other road users at risk by not being able to drive the car safely. This is illegal.And while it's not illegal to drive without shoes on, that doesn’t mean it’s right.According to the Driving Standards Agency – the body that regulates the UK driving test – “suitable shoes are particularly important behind the wheel. We would not recommend driving barefoot because you don’t have the same braking force with bare feet as you do with shoes on.”MORE ADVICE: How to contest a Parking Charge Notice RAC Breakdown Cover With our cover, the difference is in your pocket.

There are some basic guidelines you should follow when selecting footwear to drive in. Your shoe should:Have a sole no thicker than 10mm…… but the sole should not be too thin or soft.Provide enough grip to stop your foot slipping off the pedals.Not be too heavy.Not limit ankle movement.Be narrow enough to avoid accidentally depressing two pedals at once.This does technically categorise some types of footwear – such as high-heels and flip-flops – unsuitable for piloting a car.While light, flimsy and impractical footwear can be dangerous, so can sturdy, robust shoes, such as walking or snow boots.It’s important to have a good base and grip to apply pressure to the pedals, but you need a certain degree of finesse to manipulate the controls. If not, you could strike the brake and accelerator together, producing a heart-in-mouth incident.13 driving myths uncoveredDangerous driving - what it is and how to report itLearner driver insurance - from 2 hours to 5 monthsOf course, this all doesn’t stop some people. Plenty of motorists do drive in shoes that don’t afford them the proper control over the car. You wouldn’t go for a jog in high heels or flip-flops, so why use them when you’re behind the wheel?Many do. According to research by a price comparison website 40% of women take to the roads in high heels, while 39% wear flip-flops and 24% go barefoot.Over a quarter of male drivers (27%) admitted to driving in flip-flops, too, while 22% will also wear nothing on their feet.RAC VerdictDriving in less than practical shoes – or no shoes at all for that matter – is not illegal, but you have a responsibility as a driver to uphold standards on the road.If your selection of footwear hampers that, you’re putting yourself at risk.Participate in our poll below and let us know - have you ever driven barefoot?Have you ever driven barefoot?

The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. The efficient market hypothesis suggests that stock prices reflect all currently available information and any price changes that are not based on newly revealed information thus are inherently unpredictable. Others disagree and those with this viewpoint possess myriad methods and technologies which purportedly allow them to gain future price information. The Efficient Markets Hypothesis and the random walk[edit] The efficient market hypothesis posits that stock prices are a function of information and rational expectations, and that newly revealed information about a company's prospects is almost immediately reflected in the current stock price. This would imply that all publicly known information about a company, which obviously includes its price history, would already be reflected in the current price of the stock. Accordingly, changes in the stock price reflect release of new information, changes in the market generally, or random movements around the value that reflects the existing information set. Burton Malkiel, in his influential 1973 work A Random Walk Down Wall Street, claimed that stock prices could therefore not be accurately predicted by looking at price history. As a result, Malkiel argued, stock prices are best described by a statistical process called a \"random walk\" meaning each day's deviations from the central value are random and unpredictable. This led Malkiel to conclude that paying financial services persons to predict the market actually hurt, rather than helped, net portfolio return. A number of empirical tests support the notion that the theory applies generally, as most portfolios managed by professional stock predictors do not outperform the market average return after accounting for the managers' fees. Intrinsic value[edit] Intrinsic value (true value) is the perceived or calculated value of a company, including tangible and intangible factors, using fundamental analysis. It's also frequently called fundamental value. It is used for comparison with the company's market value and finding out whether the company is undervalued on the stock market or not. When calculating it, the investor looks at both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business. It is ordinarily calculated by summing the discounted future income generated by the asset to obtain the present value. Prediction methods[edit] Prediction methodologies fall into three broad categories which can (and often do) overlap. They are fundamental analysis, technical analysis (charting) and machine learning. Fundamental analysis[edit] Fundamental analysts are concerned with the company that underlies the stock itself. They evaluate a company's past performance as well as the credibility of its accounts. Many performance ratios are created that aid the fundamental analyst with assessing the validity of a stock, such as the P/E ratio. Warren Buffett is perhaps the most famous of all fundamental analysts. He uses the overall market capitalization-to-GDP ratio to indicate the relative value of the stock market in general, hence this ratio has become known as the \"Buffett indicator\". What fundamental analysis in the stock market is trying to achieve, is finding out the true value of a stock, which then can be compared with the value it is being traded with on stock markets and therefore finding out whether the stock on the market is undervalued or not. Finding out the true value can be done by various methods with basically the same principle. The principle is that a company is worth all of its future profits added together. These future profits also have to be discounted to their present value. This principle goes along well with the theory that a business is all about profits and nothing else. Contrary to technical analysis, fundamental analysis is thought of more as a long-term strategy. Fundamental analysis is built on the belief that human society needs capital to make progress and if a company operates well, it should be rewarded with additional capital and result in a surge in stock price. Fundamental analysis is widely used by fund managers as it is the most reasonable, objective and made from publicly available information like financial statement analysis. Another meaning of fundamental analysis is beyond bottom-up company analysis, it refers to top-down analysis from first analyzing the global economy, followed by country analysis and then sector analysis, and finally the company level analysis. Technical analysis[edit] Technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. The efficacy of technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results. Technical analysts or chartists are usually less concerned with any of a company's fundamentals. They seek to determine possibilities of future stock price movement largely based on trends of the past price (a form of time series analysis). Numerous patterns are employed such as the head and shoulders or cup and saucer. Alongside the patterns, techniques are used such as the exponential moving average (EMA), oscillators, support and resistance levels or momentum and volume indicators. Candle stick patterns, believed to have been first developed by Japanese rice merchants, are nowadays widely used by technical analysts. Technical analysis is rather used for short-term strategies, than the long-term ones. And therefore, it is far more prevalent in commodities and forex markets where traders focus on short-term price movements. There are some basic assumptions used in this analysis, first being that everything significant about a company is already priced into the stock, other being that the price moves in trends and lastly that history (of prices) tends to repeat itself which is mainly because of the market psychology. Machine learning[edit] With the advent of the digital computer, stock market prediction has since moved into the technological realm. Several research papers have been published with implementations of machine learning techniques to predict stock markets including, but not limited to, artificial neural networks (ANNs), random forests and supervised statistical classification. A common form of ANN in use for stock market prediction is the feed forward network utilizing the backward propagation of errors algorithm to update the network weights. These networks are commonly referred to as backpropagation networks. Another form of ANN that is more appropriate for stock prediction is the time recurrent neural network (RNN) or time delay neural network (TDNN). Examples of RNN and TDNN are the Elman, Jordan, and Elman-Jordan networks. (See the Elman And Jordan Networks.) For stock prediction with ANNs, there are usually two approaches taken for forecasting different time horizons: independent and joint. The independent approach employs a single ANN for each time horizon, for example, 1-day, 2-day, or 5-day. The advantage of this approach is that network forecasting error for one horizon won't impact the error for another horizon—since each time horizon is typically a unique problem. The joint approach, however, incorporates multiple time horizons together so that they are determined simultaneously. In this approach, forecasting error for one time horizon may share its error with that of another horizon, which can decrease performance. There are also more parameters required for a joint model, which increases the risk of overfitting. Of late, the majority of academic research groups studying ANNs for stock forecasting seem to be using an ensemble of independent ANNs methods more frequently, with greater success. An ensemble of ANNs would use low price and time lags to predict future lows, while another network would use lagged highs to predict future highs. The predicted low and high predictions are then used to form stop prices for buying or selling. Outputs from the individual \"low\" and \"high\" networks can also be input into a final network that would also incorporate volume, intermarket data or statistical summaries of prices, leading to a final ensemble output that would trigger buying, selling, or market directional change. Deep learning methods have been used to some extent. The Gated Three-Tower Transformer (GT3) is a transformer-based model designed to integrate numerical market data with textual information from social sources to enhance the accuracy of stock market predictions. Since NNs require training and can have a large parameter space; it is useful to optimize the network for optimal predictive ability. A major finding with ANNs and stock prediction is that a classification approach (vs. function approximation) using outputs in the form of buy (y=+1) and sell (y=-1) results in better predictive reliability than a quantitative output such as low or high price. Implementations using random forests and supervised statistical classification follow the same approach of predicting stock movement as a binary classification problem. Under this formulation, the sign of a future return is the label of the data, with forecasted returns being split between negative and non-negative, and the observable features used to feed the classification model can be lagged returns, the lagged sign of returns or any other lagged explanatory economic data. The loss function used to evaluate the quality of the classification model can be either the accuracy of the prediction (defined as the number of times that the classifier predicted the correct sign divided by the total number of predictions made) or the total return of a trading strategy that bought when the classifier predicted a positive sign and sold when the classifier predicted a negative return. As standard in all statistical classification problems, it is important to split the data available into training and test samples and only evaluate the model based on the test sample results as it is generally considered more trustworthy than evidence based on in-sample performance, which can be more sensitive to outliers and data mining. Out-of-sample forecasts also better reflect the information available to the forecaster in \"real time\". Data sources for market prediction[edit] Tobias Preis et al. introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves, using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends. Their analysis of Google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance, published in Scientific Reports, suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets. Out of these terms, three were significant at the 5% level (|z| > 1.96). The best term in the negative direction was \"debt\", followed by \"color\". In a study published in Scientific Reports in 2013, Helen Susannah Moat, Tobias Preis and colleagues demonstrated a link between changes in the number of views of English Wikipedia articles relating to financial topics and subsequent large stock market moves. The use of Text Mining together with Machine Learning algorithms received more attention in the last years, with the use of textual content from Internet as input to predict price changes in Stocks and other financial markets. The collective mood of Twitter messages has been linked to stock market performance. The study, however, has been criticized for its methodology. The activity in stock message boards has been mined in order to predict asset returns. The enterprise headlines from Yahoo! Finance and Google Finance were used as news feeding in a Text mining process, to forecast the Stocks price movements from Dow Jones Industrial Average.

For other uses, see Cinderella (disambiguation). CinderellaFolk taleNameCinderellaAarne–Thompson groupingATU 510 A (Persecuted Heroine)Country Ancient Greece, Egypt (oral) Italy (literary) RegionEurasia \"Cinderella\",[a] or \"The Little Glass Slipper\", is a folk tale with thousands of variants that are told throughout the world. The protagonist is a young girl living in forsaken circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune, with her ascension to the throne via marriage. The story of Rhodopis, recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo sometime between 7 BC and 23 AD, about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story. The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé in 1697 as Cendrillon and was anglicized as Cinderella. Another version was later published as Aschenputtel by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales in 1812. Although the story's title and main character's name change in different languages, in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name. The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean someone whose attributes are unrecognized, or someone unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect. In the world of sports, \"a Cinderella\" is used for an underrated team or club winning over stronger and more favored competitors. The still-popular story of Cinderella continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending plot elements, allusions, and tropes to a wide variety of media. Ancient versions[edit] European[edit] Rhodopis[edit] Main article: Rhodopis Pair of ancient sandals from Egypt The oldest known oral version of the Cinderella story is the ancient Greek story of Rhodopis, a Greek courtesan living in the colony of Naucratis in Egypt, whose name means \"Rosy-Cheeks\". The story is first recorded by the Greek geographer Strabo in his Geographica (book 17, 33): \"They [the Egyptians] tell the fabulous story that, when she was bathing, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid and carried it to Memphis; and while the king was administering justice in the open air, the eagle, when it arrived above his head, flung the sandal into his lap; and the king, stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, sent men in all directions into the country in quest of the woman who wore the sandal; and when she was found in the city of Naucratis, she was brought up to Memphis, and became the wife of the king.\" The same story is also later reported by the Roman orator Aelian (c. 175–c. 235) in his Miscellaneous History, which was written entirely in Greek. Aelian's story closely resembles the story told by Strabo, but adds that the name of the pharaoh in question was Psammetichus.[b] Aelian's account indicates that the story of Rhodopis remained popular throughout antiquity. Herodotus, some five centuries before Strabo, records a popular legend about a possibly related courtesan named Rhodopis in his Histories,: 27 claiming that she came from Thrace, was the slave of Iadmon of Samos and a fellow-slave of the story-teller Aesop, was taken to Egypt in the time of Pharaoh Amasis, and freed there for a large sum by Charaxus of Mytilene, brother of Sappho the lyric poet.: 27–28 The resemblance of the shoe-testing of Rhodopis with Cinderella's slipper has already been noted in the 19th century, by Edgar Taylor and Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. Aspasia of Phocaea[edit] A second predecessor for the Cinderella character, hailing from late Antiquity, may be Aspasia of Phocaea. Her story is told in Aelian's Varia Storia: lost her mother in early childhood and raised by her father, Aspasia, despite living in poverty, has dreamt of meeting a noble man. As she dozes off, the girl has a vision of a dove transforming into a woman, who instructs her on how to remove a physical imperfection and restore her own beauty. In another episode, she and other courtesans are made to attend a feast hosted by Persian regent Cyrus the Younger. During the banquet, the Persian King sets his sights on Aspasia herself and ignores the other women. Le Fresne[edit] Illustration of Marie de France, the author of Le Fresne, from a medieval illuminated manuscript The twelfth-century AD lai of Le Fresne (\"The Ash-Tree Girl\"), retold by Marie de France, is a variant of the \"Cinderella\" story: 41 in which a wealthy noblewoman abandons her infant daughter at the base of an ash tree outside a nunnery with a ring and brocade as tokens of her identity: 41 because she is one of twin sisters: 41 —the mother fears that she will be accused of infidelity: 41 (according to popular belief, twins were evidence of two different fathers). The infant is discovered by the porter, who names her Fresne, meaning \"Ash Tree\",: 41 and she is raised by the nuns.: 41 After she has attained maturity, a young nobleman sees her and becomes her lover.: 41 The nobleman, however, is forced to marry a woman of noble birth.: 41 Fresne accepts that she will never marry her beloved: 41 but waits in the wedding chamber as a handmaiden.: 41 She covers the bed with her own brocade: 41 but, unbeknownst to her, her beloved's bride is actually her twin sister,: 41 and her mother recognizes the brocade as the same one she had given to the daughter she had abandoned so many years before.: 41 Fresne's true parentage is revealed: 41 and, as a result of her noble birth, she is allowed to marry her beloved,: 41 while her twin sister is married to a different nobleman.: 41 Ċiklemfusa from Malta[edit] The Maltese Cinderella is named Ċiklemfusa. She is portrayed as an orphaned child in her early childhood. Before his death, her father gave her three magical objects: a chestnut, a nut and an almond. She used to work as a servant in the King's palace. Nobody ever took notice of the poor girl. One day she heard of a big ball and with the help of a magical spell turned herself into a beautiful princess. The prince fell in love with her and gave her a ring. On the following night the Prince gave her a diamond and on the third night he gave her a ring with a large gem on it. By the end of the ball Ċiklemfusa would run away hiding herself in the cellars of the Palace. She knew that the Prince was very sad about her disappearance so one day she made some krustini (typical Maltese biscuits) for him and hid the three gifts in each of them. When the Prince ate the biscuits he found the gifts he had given to the mysterious Princess and soon realized the huge mistake he had made of ignoring Ċiklemfusa because of her poor looks. They soon made marriage arrangements and she became his wife. Outside Europe[edit] Ye Xian[edit] The tale of Ye Xian first appeared in Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi around 860. In this version, Ye Xian is the daughter of the local tribal leader who died when she was young. Because her mother died before her father, she is now under the care of her father's second wife, who abused her. She befriends a fish, which is the reincarnation of her deceased mother. Her stepmother and half-sister kill the fish, but Ye Xian finds the bones, which are magical, and they help her dress appropriately for a local Festival, including a very light golden shoe. Her stepfamily recognizes her at the festival, causing her to flee and accidentally lose the shoe. Afterwards, the king of another sea island obtains the shoe and is curious about it as no one has feet that can fit the shoe. The King searches everywhere and finally reaches Ye's house, where she tries on the shoe. The king realises she is the one and takes her back to his kingdom. Her cruel stepmother and half-sister are killed by flying rocks. Variants of the story are also found in many ethnic groups in China. Tấm and Cám[edit] The Story of Tấm and Cám, from Vietnam, is similar to the Chinese version. The heroine Tấm also had a fish that was killed by the stepmother and the half-sister, and its bones also give her clothes. Later after marrying the king, Tấm was killed by her stepmother and sister, and reincarnated several times in form of a bird, a loom and a gold apple. She finally reunited with the king and lived happily ever after. Kongjwi and Patjwi[edit] Originating from Korea, Kongjwi and Patjwi is a tale similar to Disney's Cinderella, with two distinguishing characteristics: the degree of violence and the plot’s continuance past the marriage to the prince charming. The protagonist, Kongjwi, loses her mother when she was a child and her father remarries a widow. The widow also has a daughter, named Patjwi. After her father passes, the stepmother and Patjwi abuse Kongjwi by starving, beating, and working her brutally. Kongjwi is aided by animals and supernatural helpers, like a cow, a toad, a flock of birds, and a fairy. These helpers aid Kongjwi in attending a dance in honor of a magistrate. On her way back from the dance, Kongjwi loses one of her shoes, and the magistrate searches the towns to find the one who can fit the shoe. When he finds Kongjwi, he marries her. Where Disney's Cinderella ends, Kongjwi’s hardships continue into the marriage. Patjwi, envious of this marriage, pretends to ask for Kongjwi's forgiveness and then drowns Kongjwi in a pond. Patjwi then pretends to be Kongjwi and marries the magistrate. Kongjwi is then reincarnated into a lotus flower, burned by Patjwi, and reincarnated once more into a marble. With help from additional characters, Kongjwi is able to inform her husband of Patjwi’s doings. As punishment, Patjwi is ripped apart alive, her body made into jeotgal, and sent to her mother. She eats it in ignorance, and when told that it is Patjwi’s flesh, she dies out of shock. There are 17 variants of this tale known in South Korea. A notable difference from Disney's Cinderella is that Kongjwi is not a helpless maiden who relies on a man of greater power to solve her problems. Kongjwi avenges her death with her own determination and willpower. Unlike Perrault's version of Cinderella, named Cendrillon, who forgives her stepfamily when they plead for forgiveness, Kongjwi takes ownership of the principle of kwon seon jing ak (권선징악) and accomplishes her vengeance herself. The violent degree of the punishments stems from the increased violence (starvation, beating, betrayal, and ultimately murder) that Kongjwi suffered compared to the abuses Disney's Cinderella went through. Other Asian versions[edit] There exists a Cambodian version (called \"Khmer\" by the collectors) with the name Néang Kantoc. Its collectors compared it to the Vietnamese story of Tam and Cam. Another version was collected from the Cham people of Southeast Asia, with the name La Sandale d'Or (\"The Golden Sandal\") or Conte de demoiselles Hulek et Kjong (\"The tale of the ladies Hulek and Kjong\"). In Indonesia folklore there is a simmilar story Bawang Merah dan Bawang Putih (\"The tale of Shallot and Garlic\") . 20th century folktale collector Kenichi Mizusawa published an analysis of Japanese variants of Cinderella, separating them into two types: \"Nukabuku, Komebuku\" (about rival step-sisters) and \"Ubagawa\" (about the heroine's disguise). West Asian versions[edit] The Iranian version of the story is called Moon-Forehead or in Persian, Mahpishooni (Persian: ماه پیشونی, romanized: māhpišuni). The story is very similar to the German version but the girl is described as having been born with a shining moon on her forehead and after losing her natural mother, was forced to live under the ashes, to block her shining moon that could overshadow the two daughters of her stepmother. The contrast between the shining moon and ash denotes potential, similar to fire under the ashes. The location of the shine on the forehead could be a reference to superior knowledge or personality. German scholar Ulrich Marzolph [de] listed the Iranian variants of Cinderella under tale type *510A, \"Aschenputtel\", and noted that, in Iranian tradition, the type only exists in combination with type 480, \"Stirnmöndlein\". One Thousand and One Nights[edit] Several different variants of the story appear in the medieval One Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, including \"The Second Shaykh's Story\", \"The Eldest Lady's Tale\" and \"Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers\", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others, they are male. One of the tales, \"Judar and His Brethren\", departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers. Literary versions[edit] Italian author Giambattista Basile wrote the first literary version of the story. The first European version written in prose was published in Naples, Italy, by Giambattista Basile, in his Pentamerone (1634). The story itself was set in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1697), and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales (1812). The name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" (ash, cinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually soiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because they had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by sitting close to the fireplace. La gatta Cenerentola, by Basile[edit] Giambattista Basile, a Neapolitan writer, soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled Lo cunto de li cunti (The Story of Stories), or Pentamerone. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634. Plot: A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie), and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her pattens. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a patten-test, identifies Zezolla (tonnie) after the patten jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her. Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre, by Perrault[edit] Cinderella: a perfect match, an 1818 painting by Jean-Antoine Laurent [fr] One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers. Plot: A wealthy widower marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two daughters, who are equally vain and selfish. But the man also has a beautiful young daughter from his first wife, a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The stepmother, jealous of the young girl because her good graces show up her own two daughter's faults, forces her into servitude, where the girl is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After her chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in ashes, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cendrillon\" (Cinderella) by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her. One day, the prince invites all the people in the land to a royal ball. The two stepsisters gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids aren't invited to the ball. As the two stepsisters and the stepmother depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her fairy godmother magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before midnight, when the spells will be broken. At the ball, the entire court is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Fairy Godmother. She then innocently greets the two stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball. Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Fairy Godmother's help. The prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken. The prince's herald tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the herald arrives at Cinderella's home, the two stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the two stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always. Cinderella marries the prince and forgives her two stepsisters, then marrying them off to two wealthy noblemen of the court. They all lived happily ever after. The first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything. However, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at: That \"without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense. These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\" Charles Robinson illustrated Cinderella in the kitchen (1900), from Tales of Passed Times with stories by Charles Perrault. Oliver Herford illustrated Cinderella with the Fairy Godmother, inspired by Perrault's version. Cinderella or Cendrillon in French. Gustave Doré's illustration for Cendrillon, 1867 The fitting with the prince onlooking, illustration in Les Contes de Perrault by Gustave Doré, 1862 Aschenputtel, by the Brothers Grimm[edit] Another well-known version was recorded by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century. The tale is called \"Aschenputtel\" or \"Ashputtle\" or \"Ashputtel\" [“The Little Ash Girl”] or \"Cinderella\" in English translations). This version is much more violent than that of Charles Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father has not died and the two stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother in this version of the Brothers Grimm, but rather help comes from a wishing tree, which the heroine had planted on her deceased mother's grave, when she recites a certain chant. In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Brothers Grimm supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the two stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment by the princess Cinderella for their cruelty. A fairy tale very similar to the Grimm one, Aschenbrödel, was published by Ludwig Bechstein in 1845 in Deutsches Märchenbuch. Summary[edit] A wealthy gentleman's wife falls gravely ill, and as she lies on her deathbed, she calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve. One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for. The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind. Cinderella prays to the tree and the little birds provide her a beautiful dress. Art by Elenore Abbott. The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper. The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a \"dirty little Cinderella\" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the horror of the stepmother and the two limping sisters, their merely servant-girl had won without any subterfuge. The prince put Aschenputtel before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right. In a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's royal wedding, the false stepsisters had hoped to worm their way into her favour as the future queen. As she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, Aschenputtel's doves strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. It is their last chance of redemption, but since they are desperate to win the new princess' affections, they don't give up and go through the ceremony, so when the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her beloved prince march out of the church, her doves fly again, promptly striking the remaining eyes of the two evil stepsisters blind, a truly awful comeuppance they have to endure. 1812 version[edit] In addition to the absence of the punishment of the stepsisters, there are other minor differences in the first edition of 1812, some of which are reminiscent of Perrault's version. In the first edition, Cinderella's mother herself tells her to plant a tree on her grave. No bird perches on the tree but the tree itself gives the girl what she wants. The birds appear only when they help Cinderella collect lentils, a task that is assigned to her by her stepsisters rather than her stepmother, and they are not a flock but just two pigeons. On the evening of the first ball, Cinderella does not participate but she watches her stepsisters dance with the prince from the pigeon coop. Later Cinderella tells the sisters she saw them dancing, and they destroy the pigeon coop out of jealousy. In the 1812 version the tree also gives Cinderella a carriage with six horses to go to the ball and the pigeons tell her to return before midnight. The episodes in which Cinderella hides in the pigeon coop and on the pear tree were added in the 1819 version. Furthermore, not knowing Cinderella's home, the prince makes other girls in the kingdom try on the slipper before her. Plot variations and alternative tellings[edit] Cinderella by Edward Burne-Jones, 1863, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Folklorists have long studied variants on this tale across cultures. In 1893, Marian Roalfe Cox, commissioned by the Folklore Society of Britain, produced Cinderella: Three Hundred and Forty-Five Variants of Cinderella, Catskin and, Cap o'Rushes, Abstracted and Tabulated with a Discussion of Medieval Analogues and Notes. Further morphology studies have continued on this seminal work. Joseph Jacobs has attempted to reconstruct the original tale as The Cinder Maid by comparing the common features among hundreds of variants collected across Europe. The Aarne–Thompson–Uther system classifies Cinderella as type 510A, \"Persecuted Heroine\". Others of this type include The Sharp Grey Sheep; The Golden Slipper; The Story of Tam and Cam; Rushen Coatie; The Wonderful Birch; Fair, Brown and Trembling; and Katie Woodencloak.: 24–26 The magical help[edit] International versions lack the fairy godmother present in the famous Perrault's tale. Instead, the donor is her mother, incarnated into an animal (if she is dead) or transformed into a cow (if alive). In other versions, the helper is an animal, such as a cow, a bull, a pike, or a saint or angel. The bovine helper appears in some Greek versions, in \"the Balkan-Slavonic tradition of the tale\", and in some Central Asian variants. The mother-as-cow is killed by the heroine's sisters, her bones gathered and from her grave the heroine gets the wonderful dresses. Africanist Sigrid Schmidt stated that \"a typical scene\" in Kapmalaien (Cape Malays) tales is the mother becoming a fish, being eaten in fish form, the daughter burying her bones and a tree sprouting from her grave. Professor Gražina Skabeikytė-Kazlauskienė recognizes that the fish, the cow, even a female dog (in other variants), these animals represent \"the [heroine's] mother's legacy\". Jack Zipes, commenting on a Sicilian variant, concluded much the same: Cinderella is helped by her mother \"in the guise of doves, fairies, and godmothers\". In his notes to his own reconstruction, Joseph Jacobs acknowledged that the heroine's animal helper (e.g., cow or sheep) was \"clearly identified with her mother\", as well as the tree on Cinderella's mother's grave was connected to her. Villains[edit] Although many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor: in Fair, Brown and Trembling and Finette Cendron, the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are Cap O' Rushes, Catskin, All-Kinds-of-Fur, and Allerleirauh, and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there. In Katie Woodencloak, the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job. In La Cenerentola, Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is mistreated by her stepfather. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear. In some retellings, at least one stepsister is somewhat kind to Cinderella and second guesses the Stepmother's treatment. This is seen in Ever After, the two direct-to-video sequels to Walt Disney's 1950 film, and the 2013 Broadway musical. Cinderella at the Kitchen Fire, Thomas Sully, 1843 The stepsisters, 1865 edition of Cinderella Cinderella Dressing Her Sisters, Aunt Friendly's Gift, 1890 Stepsisters from Journeys through Bookland, 1922 The stepsisters, illustration in The fairy tales of Charles Perrault by Harry Clarke, 1922 Ball, ballgown, and curfew[edit] The number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The fairy godmother is Perrault's own addition to the tale. The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms's version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as in the Finnish The Wonderful Birch. Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical Into the Woods. Giambattista Basile's La gatta Cenerentola combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in Katie Woodencloak, Rushen Coatie, Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, The Story of Tam and Cam, or The Sharp Grey Sheep—these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in The Golden Slipper, a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. Gioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola, in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor. The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes. Fairy Godmother, Walter Crane, 1897 Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother by Kate Abelmann, 1913 Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother by William Henry Margetson Ballgown Cinderella, illustration in The fairy tales of Charles Perrault by Harry Clarke, 1922 Illustration by Carl Offterdinger, late 19th century At the ball, Sarah Noble Ives, c. 1912 At the ball, 1865 edition Hurrying out, 1865 edition Cinderella by Valentine Cameron Prinsep, c. 1880 Identifying item[edit] The slipper left behind, illustration in The fairy tales of Charles Perrault by Harry Clarke, 1922 The glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault's version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the Brothers Grimm, German: Aschenbroedel and Aschenputtel, for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. In Rossini's opera \"La Cenerentola\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (pantoufle de verre) had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (pantoufle de vair) in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words. However, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part. [c] Nabokov has Professor Timofey Pnin assert as fact that \"Cendrillon's shoes were not made of glass but of Russian squirrel fur – vair, in French\". The 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity. Revelation[edit] In many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it. The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other). Stepsister trying the slipper, illustration in The fairy tales of Charles Perrault by Harry Clarke, 1922 The prince pleading for Cinderella to try the shoe, illustration in The fairy tales of Charles Perrault by Harry Clarke, 1922 Trying on the Slipper, Sarah Noble Ives, c. 1912 Cinderella trying on the slipper, 1865 edition Dean & Son's Cinderella \"surprise book\" with moving images, c. 1875 Illustration by Carl Offterdinger, late 19th century Finding that the slipper fits, educational poster by Hans Printz, 1905 Trying the slipper, Askepot og Prinsen Conclusion[edit] According to Korean scholarship, East Asian versions of Cinderella \"typically\" continue as the heroine's stepmother replaces the Cinderella-like character for her own daughter,[clarification needed] while the heroine goes through a cycle of transformations. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode. In The Thousand Nights and A Night, in a tale called \"The Anklet\", the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night. In The Wonderful Birch, the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth. Part two of Dean & Son's Cinderella, 1875 Happy ending In the German version the stepsisters' eyes get pecked out by the princess' birds, her loyal friends and minions Works based on the Cinderella story[edit] Works based on the story of Cinderella include: Opera and ballet[edit] Massenet's opera Cendrillon Cendrillon (1759) by Jean-Louis Laruette Cendrillon (1810) by Nicolas Isouard, libretto by Charles-Guillaume Étienne Agatina, o la virtù premiata [it] (1814) by Stefano Pavesi La Cenerentola (1817) by Gioachino Rossini Cinderella (1893) by Baron Boris Vietinghoff-Scheel Cendrillon (1894–95) by Jules Massenet, libretto by Henri Caïn Aschenbrödel (1901) by Johann Strauss II, adapted and completed by Josef Bayer Cinderella (1901–02) by Gustav Holst La Cenerentola (1902) by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari Cendrillon (1904) by Pauline García-Viardot Aschenbrödel (1905) by Leo Blech, libretto by Richard Batka Das Märchen vom Aschenbrödel (1941) by Frank Martin Zolushka or Cinderella (1945) by Sergei Prokofiev La Cenicienta (1966) by Jorge Peña Hen Cinderella, a \"pantomime opera\" (1979) by Peter Maxwell Davies Cinderella (1980) by Paul Reade Cinderella (1997) by Matthew Bourne taking place in 1940 London using the music of Sergei Prokofiev My First Cinderella (2013) directed by George Williamson and Loipa Araújo Cinderella (2016) by Alma Deutscher Theatre[edit] Pantomime at the Adelphi In 1804 Cinderella was presented at Drury Lane Theatre, London, described as \"A new Grand Allegorical Pantomimic Spectacle\" though it was very far in style and content from the modern pantomime. However, it included notable clown Joseph Grimaldi playing the part of a servant called Pedro, the antecedent of today's character Buttons. In 1820 Harlequin and Cinderella at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden had much of the modern story (taken from the opera La Cenerentola) by Rossini but was a Harlequinade again featuring Grimaldi. In 1830 Rophino Lacy used Rossini's music but with spoken dialogue in a comic opera with many of the main characters: the Baron, the two stepsisters and Pedro the servant all as comic characters, plus a Fairy Queen instead of a magician. However it was the conversion of this via burlesque and rhyming couplets by Henry Byron that led to what was effectively the modern pantomime in both story and style at the Royal Strand Theatre in 1860: Cinderella! Or the Lover, the Lackey, and the Little Glass Slipper. In the traditional pantomime version the opening scene takes place in a forest with a hunt in progress; here Cinderella first meets Prince Charming and his \"right-hand man\" Dandini, whose name and character come from Gioachino Rossini's opera (La Cenerentola). Cinderella mistakes Dandini for the Prince and the Prince for Dandini. Her father, Baron Hardup, is under the thumb of his two stepdaughters, the Ugly sisters, and has a servant, Cinderella's friend Buttons. (Throughout the pantomime, the Baron is continually harassed by the Broker's Men (often named after current politicians) for outstanding rent. The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball. However, she must return by midnight, as it is then that the spell ceases. Musicals[edit] Cinderella by Rodgers and Hammerstein was produced for television three times and staged live in various productions. A version ran in 1958 at the London Coliseum with a cast including Tommy Steele, Yana, Jimmy Edwards, Kenneth Williams and Betty Marsden. This version was augmented with several other Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs plus a song written by Tommy Steele, \"You and Me\". In 2013, a Broadway production opened, with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane, and ran for 770 performances. In the acclaimed 2022 VTT production of Cinderella, Naomi Infeld will be playing Anastasia. Mr. Cinders, a musical, opened at the Adelphi Theatre, London in 1929 and received a film version in 1934. Cindy, a 1964 Off-Broadway musical, was composed by Johnny Brandon and has had many revivals. La Gatta Cenerentola, a 1976 Italian musical in Neapolitan language with music and lyrics by Roberto De Simone, based on Giambattista Basile's version of the story. Into the Woods, a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine, includes Cinderella as one of the many fairy-tale characters in the plot. This is partly based on the Grimm Brothers' version of \"Cinderella\", including the enchanted birds, mother's grave, three balls, and mutilation and blinding of the stepsisters. It opened on Broadway in 1987 and has had many revivals. In this show, Cinderella is actually the Baker's ex-sister-in-law, since she married her prince and her prince's brother married Rapunzel, and the baker is Rapunzel's brother. After she divorced the prince she became Rapunzel and the Baker's ex-sister-in-law. Cinderella is a musical composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber that premiered in the West End in 2021. Cinderella’s Castle, an upcoming musical by Team Starkid announced in March 2024 and set to showcase in summer of 2024. Book is by Nick & Matt Lang and music and lyrics by Jeff Blim.

The shadow of a witch is cast onto the wall at left. Bloody Mary is a legend of a ghost, phantom, or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. Bloody Mary appearances are mostly witnessed in group participation play. Ritual[edit] Historically, the divination ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry. In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of catoptromancy. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly lit or candle-lit room. The name must be uttered 13 times (or some other specified number of times). The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch, and ghost that can either be friendly, evil, or a demonic spirit, and is sometimes seen covered in blood (hence the name). The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood,[citation needed] or scratching their eyes out. Some variations of the ritual call Bloody Mary by a different name—\"Hell Mary\" and \"Mary Worth\" are popular examples. The modern legend of Hanako-san in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology. Phenomenon explanations[edit] Staring into a mirror in a dimly lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate. Facial features may appear to \"melt\", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the \"strange-face illusion\", is believed to be a consequence of a \"dissociative identity effect\", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way. Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of Troxler's fading and possibly apophenia, or even self-hypnosis.[citation needed] Identification[edit] There is some debate on the identification of Bloody Mary and if she is based on a real woman. A number of historical figures have been put forward as candidates for 'Mary' including Mary I of England (daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon), who had around 300 religious Protestant dissenters burned at the stake during her reign, earning her the nickname 'Bloody Mary'; Elizabeth Báthory, a 17th-century Hungarian countess who allegedly tortured and killed around 660 girls and women, bathed in their blood, and was accused of vampirism; and Mary Worth, who has been identified as either a woman who killed slaves escaping the American South via the Underground Railroad or a woman who was burned at the stake during the Witch trials in the early modern period.

By Harriet Meyers Published: Dec 07, 2021 | 4 Minutes Published: Dec 07, 2021 | 4 Minutes Left: Human view of a dog with a orange, red, and yellow rop in his mouth. Right: The same scene through canine eyes, as interpreted through the Dog Vision Image Processing Tool. toys eye care vision Can dogs see color? The popular notion that dogs only see in black and white is false Dogs can make out yellow and blue, and combinations of those colors This means the best toys for your dog may be those in blue and yellow hues Is everything in a dog’s world black and white? That idea that dogs can’t see color was widely accepted for decades, but new research and conclusions about canine anatomy and behavior have shown that while dogs can’t see the same colors humans do, dogs can still see some colors. Technicolor may be beyond their comprehension, but research shows that the dog’s eye can see much more than shades of gray. What Is Color Blindness? English scientist John Dalton (1766–1844) conducted some of the first studies on congenital color blindness in the late 18th century. Dalton became aware of the phenomenon because he and his brother could not recognize some colors. They confused scarlet with green and pink with blue. In humans, the defect in red-green perception is the most common form of color deficiency. As many as 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women with Northern European ancestry have red-green color blindness. It is caused by abnormalities in color-detecting molecules, known as cones, in the retina. The retina is a lining at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical impulses. These signals are then conveyed, through the optic nerve, to the brain, where an image is formed. People missing some of these color-detecting molecules (also known as photoreceptors) won’t recognize certain light wavelengths. This is what makes them color blind, although they actually can make out some hues. Red-green color-blind people can still discern yellow and blue, but items in red will appear gray or brown to them.

Left: Human view of a blue and red tennis ball sitting in the green grass. Right: The same tennis ball through canine eyes, as interpreted through the Dog Vision Image Processing Tool. This helps show dogs are better able to distinguish blues than reds. Myths About Dogs Seeing Colors The notion that dogs see only in shades of black and white has been attributed to Will Judy, a lifelong dog fancier, writer, and past publisher of Dog Week magazine. He claimed to be the first to declare that dogs had poor vision and thought they were able to see single shades and tones and only general outlines and shapes. “It’s likely that all the external world appears to them as varying highlights of black and gray,” Judy wrote in his 1937 manual, “Training the Dog.” In the 1960s, other researchers hypothesized that the only mammals that can discern color are primates. There was little research to back up these assertions, especially the one about dogs. Nevertheless, it soon became apparent that our canine pals are color blind. Are Dogs Color Blind or Spectrum Challenged? In the last few decades, examinations of the canine eye structure have revealed some differences in basic design between humans and dogs. Evolution and function have driven these differences. Dogs developed their senses as nocturnal hunters, tracking and catching their food at night. Therefore, their eyes adapted to see well in the dark and to catch movement. “For the purpose of hunting in the dark, canine eyes have a larger lens and corneal surface and a reflective membrane, known as a tapetum, that enhances night vision,” explains AKC’s chief veterinary officer, Dr. Jerry Klein. “They also have more rods, which improves low-light vision, in the retina.” The retina is where scientists have also found the key to the difference in color perception between dogs and people. The retina is composed of millions of light-sensing cells. These include: Rods, which are extremely sensitive cells that catch movement and work in low light. Cones that work in bright light and control color perception. Dogs have more rods than cones in their retina, whereas people have more cones, and this apparently makes the difference in color perception. Humans and a few other primate species are trichromatic, which means they have three kinds of cones. Dogs are dichromatic, and have only two types. Each type of cone registers a different light wavelength. The one for red and green gives humans their appreciation for a red rose or a Granny Smith apple. Dogs, and some color-blind people, are missing red-green cones. Meanwhile, there are some types of fish and birds that can see an even broader range of the color spectrum than people can. There are many types of birds and fish that are tetrachromatic — they have a fourth type of cone receptor to absorb ultraviolet light. Dog Vision, a website devoted to canine color perception, printed this side-by-side comparison of how people and dogs register the color spectrum. Different-Colored Dog Toys Through the Lens of a Dog Human view (left) and dog view (right) of a dog with a pink frisbee. The most popular colors for dog toys today are red or orange despite the fact that these colors are difficult for dogs to see. When you throw a red, pink, or orange toy, it may be difficult for the dog to see compared to the grass. Human view (left) and dog view (right) of a dog with a yellow tennis ball. Dogs are able to distinguish yellow and blue from green, which may explain why they prefer yellow tennis balls over toys of different colors. Human view (left) and dog view (right) of a dog with a blue ball. Dogs are able to distinguish yellow and blue from green, which may explain why they prefer blue and yellow toys over toys of different colors. So, Can Dogs See Colors Like We Can? Scientists now believe that a dog’s color vision is similar to that of a person who has red-green color blindness, according to research conducted by Jay Neitz, who runs the Neitz Color Vision Lab in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Washington. Dogs can make out yellow and blue, and combinations of those colors. This renders a lot of the world grayish-brown. That lush green lawn? It probably looks like a field of dead hay. That bright red velvet cushion? Still comfy, but it probably comes across as a dark brown blob to the dog. Dog Vision offers an online tool to help you see things as your dog sees them. There are also apps that you can use to see what your dog is seeing at any time. What Does This Mean to You and Your Dog? Now that you know that dogs don’t see certain colors, it would make sense to choose products for them that feature the colors they can see. This knowledge may help explain why some dogs go crazy over yellow tennis balls, but are apathetic about the same ball in pink or red. When you’re throwing a ball or a bumper for your dog to retrieve in the grass or the lake, don’t choose something red, or he’s likely to lose it. And if you’re teaching him to differentiate between two toys or obedience training dumbells, it would be wise to go for one blue and one yellow. AKC Family Dog columnist Stanley Coren offered this observation: “The most popular colors for dog toys today are red or orange. However red and orange are difficult for dogs to see. That means that when your own pet version of Lassie runs right past the toy that you tossed, she may not be stubborn or stupid. It may be your fault for choosing a toy with a color that is hard to discriminate from the green grass of your lawn.” This article is intended solely as general guidance, and does not constitute health or other professional advice.

You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources. This is a list of notable conspiracy theories. Many conspiracy theories relate to supposed clandestine government plans and elaborate murder plots. They usually deny consensus opinion and cannot be proven using historical or scientific methods, and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies, such as Germany's pretense for invading Poland in World War II. In principle, conspiracy theories might not always be false, and their validity depends on evidence as for any theory. However, they are often implausible prima facie due to their convoluted and all-encompassing nature. Conspiracy theories tend to be internally consistent and correlate with each other; they are generally designed to resist falsification either by evidence against them or a lack of evidence for them. Psychologists sometimes attribute proclivities toward conspiracy theories to a number of psychopathological conditions such as paranoia, schizotypy, narcissism, and insecure attachment, or to a form of cognitive bias called \"illusory pattern perception\". However, the current scientific consensus holds that most conspiracy theorists are not pathological, but merely exaggerate certain cognitive tendencies that are universal in the human brain and probably have deep evolutionary origins, such as natural inclinations towards anxiety and agent detection. Aviation Numerous conspiracy theories pertain to air travel and aircraft. Incidents such as the 1955 bombing of the Kashmir Princess, the 1985 Arrow Air Flight 1285 crash, the 1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash, the 1987 Helderberg Disaster, the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the 1994 Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash as well as various aircraft technologies and alleged sightings, have all spawned theories of foul play that deviate from official verdicts. Black helicopters Main article: Black helicopter This conspiracy theory emerged in the US in the 1960s. The John Birch Society originally promoted it, asserting that a United Nations force would soon arrive in black helicopters to bring the US under UN control. A similar theory concerning so-called \"phantom helicopters\" appeared in the UK in the 1970s. The theory re-emerged in the 1990s during the presidency of Bill Clinton, and was \"energetically\" promoted by writer Jim Keith in his book Black Helicopters Over America. By the 2000s, the term \"black helicopters\" became a shorthand for antigovernment conspiracy theories that \"stretch the bounds of credulity\", such as those espoused by militia groups and a number of guests of talk show host Glenn Beck. Chemtrails Main article: Chemtrail conspiracy theory A high-flying jet's engines leaving a condensation trail (contrail) Also known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), this theory alleges that water condensation trails (\"contrails\") from aircraft consist of chemical or biological agents, or contain a supposedly toxic mix of aluminum, strontium and barium, under secret government policies. An estimated 17% of people globally believe the theory to be true or partly true. In 2016, the Carnegie Institution for Science published the first-ever peer-reviewed study of the chemtrail theory; 76 out of 77 participating atmospheric chemists and geochemists stated that they had seen no evidence to support the chemtrail theory, or stated that chemtrail theorists rely on poor sampling. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 The destruction of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by Soviet jets in 1983 has long drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists. The theories range from allegations of a planned espionage mission, to a US government cover-up, to the consumption of the passengers' remains by giant crabs. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 See also: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappearance theories The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in southeast Asia in March 2014 has prompted many theories. One theory suggests that this plane was hidden away and reintroduced as Flight MH17 later the same year in order to be shot down over Ukraine for political purposes. American conspiracy theorist James H. Fetzer has placed responsibility for the disappearance with the then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Historian Norman Davies has promoted the conspiracy theory that hackers remotely took over a Boeing Honeywell Uninterruptible Autopilot, supposedly installed on board, remotely piloting the aircraft to Antarctica. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014. This event has spawned numerous alternative theories. These variously include allegations that it was secretly Flight MH370, that the plane was actually shot down by the Ukrainian Air Force to frame Russia, that it was part of a conspiracy to conceal the \"truth\" about HIV (seven disease specialists were on board), or that the Illuminati or Israel was responsible. Business and industry New Coke was manufactured between 1985 and 2002. Deepwater Horizon Multiple conspiracy theories pertain to a fatal oil-rig industrial accident in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, alleging sabotage by those seeking to promote environmentalism, or a strike by North Korean or Russian submarines. Elements of such theories had been suggested or promoted by US radio host Rush Limbaugh. New Coke Main article: New Coke § Conspiracy theories A theory claims that The Coca-Cola Company intentionally changed to an inferior formula with New Coke, with the intent either of driving up demand for the original product or permitting the reintroduction of the original with a new formula using cheaper ingredients. Coca-Cola president Donald Keough rebutted this charge: \"The truth is, we're not that dumb, and we're not that smart.\" Deaths and disappearances Conspiracy theories frequently emerge following the deaths of prominent leaders and public figures. Death of Nero In ancient times, widespread conspiracy theories were circulated pertaining to the death of the Roman emperor Nero, who committed suicide in 68 AD. Some of these theories claimed that Nero had actually faked his death and was secretly still alive, but in hiding, plotting to reestablish his reign. In most of these stories, he was said to have fled to the East, where he was still influential. Other theories held that Nero would return from the dead to retake his throne. Many early Christians feared Nero's return to resume his vicious anti-Christian persecutions. The Book of Revelation may allude to these conspiracy theories in its description of the slaughtered head returned to life. John F. Kennedy assassination Main article: John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories John F. Kennedy in the presidential limousine shortly before his assassination In modern times, multiple conspiracy theories concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 have emerged. Vincent Bugliosi estimated that over 1,000 books had been written about the Kennedy assassination, at least ninety percent of which are works supporting the view that there was a conspiracy. As a result of this, the Kennedy assassination has been described as \"the mother of all conspiracies\". The countless individuals and organizations that have been accused of involvement in the Kennedy assassination include the CIA, the Mafia, sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro, the KGB, or even some combination thereof. It is also frequently asserted that the United States federal government intentionally covered up crucial information in the aftermath of the assassination to prevent the conspiracy from being discovered. Disappearance of Harold Holt Harold Holt in 1966. Main article: Disappearance of Harold Holt At approximately 12:20pm on 17 December 1967, then-Prime Minister of Australia Harold Holt, disappeared while swimming at Cheviot Beach, near the town of Portsea in Victoria. While it is presumed that Holt drowned, the topic is still described as one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in Australian history and has spawned many conspiracy theories. The conspiracy theories have been widely criticised by the public and by members of Holt's own family. In 2007, television presenter Ray Martin hosted the television special Who Killed Harold Holt?, which first aired on the Nine Network on 20 November 2007. While the special explored numerous theories about Holt's disappearance, it gave particular credence to the theory that he committed suicide. In the lead-up to the airing of the program, Holt's biographer, Tom Frame, described the allegations made in the special as \"unjustified and contrary to all the evidence\" in an opinion piece published in The Australian newspaper, while Holt's son, Sam, said he was \"amazed that people can still keep bringing up [these] fallacious theories\". Another conspiracy theory is that Holt was actually a spy for the Chinese government (under both the Nationalist and Communist governments) ever since he began studying at the University of Melbourne in 1929 and that he \"pretended to drown\", instead theorising that once below the surface two Chinese frogmen transported him to China in a submarine. This theory also claims that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) covered up any evidence. This theory was first promoted in British writer Anthony Grey's 1983 novel The Prime Minister Was a Spy, which attracted controversy in Australia. Other conspiracy theories claim that Holt was assassinated. Targets of these claims include North Vietnam and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Death of other prominent figures The deaths of prominent figures of all types attract conspiracy theorists, sometimes elaborating on historically verified conspiracies such as the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln, as well as the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr., Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Eric V of Denmark, Dmitry Ivanovich, Sheikh Rahman, Yitzhak Rabin, Zachary Taylor, George S. Patton, Diana, Princess of Wales, Dag Hammarskjöld, Kurt Cobain, Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe, Tupac Shakur, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Notorious B.I.G, Pope John Paul I, Jill Dando, Olof Palme, member of Linkin Park Chester Bennington, Paul Walker, biological warfare authority David Kelly, Haitian president Jovenel Moïse, Indian freedom fighter Subash Chandra Bose, and Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput. There are also claims that deaths were covered up. Such theories include the \"Paul is dead\" claim alleging that Paul McCartney died in a car accident in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike Scottish orphan named William Shears Cambell who also went by Billy Shears, and that The Beatles hinted at this in their songs, most noticeably \"Revolution 9\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Glass Onion\", and \"I Am the Walrus\", as well on the covers of Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Magical Mystery Tour. Another is the conspiracy theory, widely circulated in Nigeria, which alleges that Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari died in 2017 and was replaced by a look-alike Sudanese impostor. Many fans of punk-pop star Avril Lavigne claim that she died at the height of her fame and was replaced by a look-alike named Melissa. The Melania Trump replacement theory proposes the same of the former US First Lady. Inverted theories concerning deaths are also known, prominently claims that Elvis Presley's death was faked and that Adolf Hitler survived the Second World War and fled to the Americas, to Antarctica, or to the Moon. Theories that Hitler had survived are known to have been deliberately promoted by the government of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin as part of a disinformation campaign. The disappearance, and often presumed death, of an individual may also become a cause for conspiracy theorists. Theories of a cover-up surrounding the 1974 disappearance of Lord Lucan following the murder of his family's nanny include, for example, allegations of a suicide plot whereby his body was fed to tigers at Howletts Zoo. Numerous conspiracy theories have also attended the 2007 disappearance of English girl Madeleine McCann. The murder of Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich spawned several right-wing conspiracy theories, including that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016, which runs contrary to US intelligence's conclusion that the leaked DNC emails were part of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Law enforcement as well as fact-checking websites like PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org stated that these theories were false and unfounded. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post called the fabrications fake news and falsehoods. Economics and society New World Order Main article: New World Order (conspiracy theory) Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Bavarian Illuminati The New World Order theory states that a group of international elites control governments, industry, and media organizations, with the goal of establishing global hegemony. They are alleged to be implicated in most of the major wars of the last two centuries, to carry out secretly staged events, and to deliberately manipulate economies. The New World Order has been connected to a wide range of actors including the Illuminati (see § Illuminati), Jews (§ Antisemitism), colluding world governments or corporations, NGOs such as the World Economic Forum (Great Reset § Conspiracy theories), and secretive organizations such as Bohemian Grove, Le Cercle, and Skull and Bones. Theorists believe that a wide range of musicians, including Beyoncé and Whitney Houston, have been associated with the \"group.\" Prominent theorists include Mark Dice and David Icke. Predictive programming Not to be confused with Predicative programming. See also: The Simpsons § Purported foreshadowing of actual events Many theorists allege that the contents of fictional media, in a process called \"predictive programming,\" are manipulated to reference planned false flags, technological innovations, social changes, and other future events. These references are understood to be a conditioning and brainwashing tool, such that the public becomes more accepting of these events than they would be otherwise. Predictive programming has been used to explain events such as the September 11 attacks and COVID-19 pandemic, and has been connected with media such as Die Hard, The Simpsons, and Contagion. George Soros Further information: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump and List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump Hungarian-American investor George Soros has been the subject of conspiracy theories since the 1990s. Soros has used his wealth to promote many political, social, educational and scientific causes, disbursing grants totaling an estimated $11 billion up to 2016. However, theories tend to assert that Soros is in control of a large portion of the world's wealth and governments, and that he secretly funds a large range of persons and organizations for nefarious purposes, such as antifa, which some conspiracy theorists claim is a single far-left militant group. Such ideas have been promoted by Viktor Orban, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Bill O'Reilly, Roy Moore, Alex Jones, Paul Gosar, and Ben Garrison. Soros conspiracy theories are sometimes linked to antisemitic conspiracy theories. Freemasonry Conspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons have proliferated since the 18th century. Theorists have alleged that Freemasons control large parts of the economies or judiciaries of a number of countries, and have alleged Masonic involvement in the British enquiry regarding the sinking of the Titanic and in the crimes of Jack the Ripper. Notable among theorists has been American inventor Samuel Morse, who in 1835 published a book of his own conspiracy theories. Freemason conspiracy theories have also been linked to certain antisemitic conspiracy theories. Üst akıl Conspiracy theories in Turkey started to dominate public discourse during the late reign of the Justice and Development Party and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In 2014, Erdoğan coined the term üst akıl (\"mastermind\") to denote the alleged command and control institution, somewhat ambiguously placed with the government of the United States, in a comprehensive conspiracy to weaken or even dismember Turkey, by orchestrating every political actor and action perceived hostile by Turkey. Erdoğan as well as the Daily Sabah newspaper have on multiple occasions alleged that very different non-state actors—like the Salafi jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the libertarian socialist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and supporters of Fethullah Gülen—were attacking Turkey at the same time in a well-coordinated campaign. One instance of promoting the \"mastermind\" conspiracy theory occurred in February 2017, when then-Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek claimed that earthquakes in the western province of Çanakkale could have been organized by dark external powers aiming to destroy Turkey's economy with an \"artificial earthquake\" near Istanbul. In another example, in November 2017, the Islamist newspaper Yeni Akit claimed that the fashion trend of \"ripped denim\" jeans was in fact a means of communication, via specific forms of rips and holes, between agents of foreign states and their collaborators in Turkey. Espionage Israel animal spying There are conspiracy theories alleging that Israel uses animals to conduct espionage or to attack people. These are often associated with conspiracy theories about Zionism. Matters of interest to theorists include a series of shark attacks in Egypt in 2010, Hezbollah's accusations of the use of \"spying\" eagles, and the 2011 capture of a griffon vulture carrying an Israeli-labeled satellite tracking device. Harold Wilson Numerous persons, including former MI5 officer Peter Wright and Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn, have alleged that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson was secretly a KGB spy. Historian Christopher Andrew has lamented that a number of people have been \"seduced by Golitsyn's fantasies\". Malala Yousafzai Conspiracy theories concerning Malala Yousafzai are widespread in Pakistan, elements of which originate from a 2013 satirical piece in Dawn. These theories variously allege that she is a Western spy, or that her attempted murder by the Taliban in 2012 was a secret operation to further discredit the Taliban, and was organized by her father and the CIA and carried out by actor Robert de Niro disguised as an Uzbek homeopath. Ethnicity, race and religion Antisemitism Main articles: Antisemitic trope and International Jewish conspiracy First edition of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion Since at least the Middle Ages, antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory. In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells, had been responsible for the death of Jesus, and ritually consumed the blood of Christians. The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world. Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of communism, or the hoax The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1903), which outlines a supposed high council of Jews planning to control the world. Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler. Antisemitic theories persist today concerning banking, Hollywood, the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government of the United States. These theories all allege plots to establish a world tyranny. Holocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory, claiming that the Nazi extermination of European Jews is a hoax designed to win sympathy for Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel. Holocaust deniers include Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the chemist with a conviction for inciting racial hatred Germar Rudolf and the discredited author David Irving. Reptilian conspiracies, prominent in ufology theories, have also been linked to anti-semitism, as \"a very old trope with disturbing links to anti-immigrant and antisemitic hostilities dating to the 19th century.\" Conspiracy author David Icke suggests numerous Jewish political figures are reptilian shapeshifters and \"the Jewish Rothschild family is part of a bloodline of reptilian humanoids that secretly control the world\". Critics contend these theories to be antisemitic, although he denies animosity towards Jewish people. Other far-right ufologists speculate that the Jewish race originated from genetic engineering by malevolent extraterrestrials engaged in interstellar conflict with Anunnaki or Pleiadians. Anti-Armenianism See also: Anti-Armenianism and Denial of the Armenian Genocide Conspiracy theories that allege that the Armenians wield secret political power are prevalent in Azerbaijan and have been promoted by the government, including President Ilham Aliyev. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has claimed that the Russian media is run by Armenians. American writer and disbarred lawyer Samuel Weems has claimed that the Armenian genocide was a hoax designed to defraud Christian nations of billions of dollars, and that the Armenian Church instigates terrorist attacks. Filmmaker Davud Imanov has accused the Armenians of plotting against Azerbaijan and has claimed that the Karabakh movement was a plot by the CIA to destroy the Soviet Union. Anti-Baháʼísm Main article: Persecution of Baháʼís Iran's Baháʼí Faith minority has been the target of conspiracy theories alleging involvement with hostile powers. Iranian government officials and others have claimed that Baháʼís have been variously agents of the Russian, British, American or Israeli governments. An apocryphal and historically inaccurate book published in Iran, entitled The Memoirs of Count Dolgoruki, details a theory that the Bahá'ís intend to destroy Islam. Such anti-Baháʼí accusations have been dismissed as having no factual foundation. Anti-Catholicism See also: Anti-Catholicism, Vatican conspiracy theories, Jesuit conspiracy theories, and Controversies about Opus Dei Anti-Catholic cartoon depicting Catholicism as an octopus, from H. E. Fowler and Jeremiah J. Crowley's The Pope (1913) Since the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, theories about Catholic conspiracies have taken many forms, including the 17th-century Popish Plot allegations, claims by persons such as William Blackstone that Catholics posed a secret threat to Britain, and numerous writings by authors such as Samuel Morse, Rebecca Reed, Avro Manhattan, Jack Chick and Alberto Rivera. Theorists often claim that the Pope is the Antichrist, accuse Catholics of suppressing evidence incompatible with Church teachings, and describe Catholics as being involved with secret evil rituals, crimes, and other plots. In 1853, the Scottish minister Alexander Hislop published his anti-Catholic pamphlet The Two Babylons, in which he claims that the Catholic Church is secretly a continuation of the pagan religion of ancient Babylon, the product of a millennia-old conspiracy founded by the Biblical king Nimrod and the Assyrian queen Semiramis. It also claims that modern Catholic holidays, including Christmas and Easter, are actually pagan festivals established by Semiramis and that the customs associated with them are pagan rituals. Modern scholars have unanimously rejected the book's arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of Babylonian religion, but variations of them are still accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants. The Jehovah's Witnesses periodical The Watchtower frequently published excerpts from it until the 1980s. The book's thesis has also featured prominently in the conspiracy theories of racist groups, such as The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord. Fears of a Catholic takeover of the US have been especially persistent, prompted by large-scale Catholic immigration in the 19th century and Ku Klux Klan propaganda. Such fears have attached to Catholic political candidates such as Al Smith and John F. Kennedy. Pope John Paul I died in September 1978, only a month after his election to the papacy. The timing of his death and the Vatican's alleged difficulties with ceremonial and legal death procedures has fostered several conspiracy theories. The elderly Pope Benedict XVI's resignation in February 2013, officially due to \"lack of strength of mind and body\", prompted theories in Italian publications such as La Repubblica and Panorama that he resigned to avoid the exposure of an underground gay Catholic network. Antichrist Apocalyptic prophecies, particularly Christian claims about the End Times, have inspired a range of conspiracy theories. Many of these cite the Antichrist, a leader who will supposedly create an oppressive world empire. Countless figures have been called Antichrist, including Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, Russian emperor Peter the Great, Saladin, Pope John XXII, Benito Mussolini, Barack Obama, French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, and German Führer Adolf Hitler. Bible and Jesus Bible conspiracy theories posit that significant parts of the New Testament are false, or have been omitted. Various groups both real (such as the Vatican) and fake (such as the Priory of Sion) are said to suppress relevant information concerning, for example, the dating of the Shroud of Turin. Much of this line of conspiracy theory has been stimulated by a debunked book titled The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), which claimed that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers and that their offspring and descendants were secretly hidden in Europe following the death of Jesus, from whom the then-living French draughtsman Pierre Plantard claimed descent. Interest in this hoax saw a resurgence following the publication of Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code. The Gospel of Afranius, an atheistic Russian work published in 1995 with an English translation published in 2022, proposes politically motivated gaslighting as the origin of the foundational Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus. Islamist \"War against Islam\" is a conspiracy theory in Islamist discourse that describes a plot to destroy Islamic society. The alleged plotters are non-Muslims and \"false Muslims\" in collusion with Western powers whose efforts are a continuation of the Medieval Crusades. Anti-Islamic Since the September 11 Attacks, many anti-Islamic conspiracy theories have emerged. Love Jihad, also called Romeo Jihad, refers to a conspiracy theory that Muslim men try to convert non-Muslim women to Islam by feigning love. The \"Eurabia\" theory alleges a Muslim plot to Islamize Europe and the West through mass immigration and high Moslem birth rates. US President Barack Obama was accused of being a secret Muslim. Paganism See also: Witch-cult hypothesis A theory holds that the witch trials of the Early Modern period were an effort to suppress pre-Christian, pagan religions that had endured the Christianization of Europe. A far-right pro-pagan conspiracy theory suggests that Christianity was created as a Jewish scheme to undermine the Aryan race. Paul the Apostle Paul the Apostle makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval Jewish anti-Christian polemic, Toledot Yeshu, as a spy for the rabbis. Muslims have long believed that Paul purposefully corrupted the original revealed teachings of Jesus by introducing elements of paganism, the theology of the cross, and the idea of original sin producing the need for redemption. The Baháʼí Faith also regards Paul as a false or misguided preacher who corrupted Jesus's original message. In this sense, he is seen as the real \"Judas\" who betrayed Jesus. Pre-Māori settlement of New Zealand Main article: Pre-Māori settlement of New Zealand theories Racism White genocide conspiracy theory is a white nationalist notion that immigration, integration, low fertility rates and abortion are being promoted in predominantly white countries to dispossess or eliminate white people. A 2017 study in France by IFOP, for example, found that 48% of participants believed that political and media elites are conspiring to replace white people with immigrants. The idea of Black genocide in the United States holds that African Americans are the victims of genocide by white Americans. Arguments for its existence have focused on historical persecution of African Americans through lynchings, racial discrimination, and forced sterilization. Some accusations of genocide have been described as conspiracy theories, in particular the characterization of birth control and medical abortions as part of a deliberate and ongoing genocide of African Americans. \"The Plan\" is an alleged plot by white power brokers in Washington, D.C., to take control of the city's local government from African Americans, who were a majority of the city's population from the late 1950s to the early 2010s and remain its largest ethnic group. While most residents, of any race, do not believe in an intentional plan to move or displace black people, many still feel that gentrification, urban renewal projects and the demolition of black neighborhoods have contributed (intentionally or otherwise) to Washington's changing demographics. Fandom, celebrity relationships, and shipping Numerous conspiracy theories surround the desire by followers of a fandom for two celebrities to be in a romantic and/or sexual relationship, known as shipping. Many real-person shipping conspiracy theories involve claims that the pregnancies and children of partnered or married celebrity couples are fake. Proponents of celebrity shipping conspiracies that ship two celebrities of the same gender typically argue that they are being pro-LGBT by supporting two people who are forcibly closeted by a homophobic industry. Conspiracy communities about celebrity relationships tend to be created and dominated by women. Larries Further information: Larries Larries are a group of shipping conspiracy theorist fans, centered around the idea that two members of the boy band One Direction, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson, are secretly a couple. These conspiracy theorists falsely claim that Styles and Tomlinson have been closeted by their management since the inception of the band, despite multiple claims otherwise by Styles, Tomlinson, their friends, and their family. Government, politics, and conflict See also: List of political conspiracies In the modern era, political conspiracy theories are often spread using fake news on social media. A 2017 study of fake news, which was published by the Shorenstein Center, found that \"misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right\". Political conspiracy theories may take generalized and wide-ranging forms concerning wars and international bodies, but may also be seen at a localized level, such as the conspiracy theory pertaining to the 118th Battalion, a British regiment stationed in Kitchener, Ontario, during World War I, which was believed by some in Kitchener to still be present years after the war ended and to be controlling local politics. Crisis actors Further information: \"Crisis actor\" as a conspiracy theory motif Crisis actors are individuals who portray disaster victims in first responder training exercises. Conspiracy theories allege that mass shooting and similar traumatic events are actually staged, with victims and their families being portrayed by covert crisis actors. Illuminati in Europe Conspiracy theories concerning the Illuminati, a short-lived 18th-century Enlightenment-era secret society, appear to have originated in the late 19th century, when some Catholic conservatives in Europe came to believe that the group had been responsible for the French Revolution of 1789–1799. Hoaxes about the Illuminati were later spread in the 1960s by a group of American practical jokers known as the Discordians who wrote a series of fake letters about the Illuminati to Playboy. False flag operations The World Trade Center towers prior to 9/11 False flag operations are covert operations designed to appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. Some allegations of false flag operations have been verified or are subjects of legitimate historical dispute (such as the 1933 Reichstag arson attack). Unsubstantiated allegations of such operations feature strongly in conspiracy theories. Such allegations have attached to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Oklahoma City bombing, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, and the Euromaidan massacre. The rise of ISIS gave rise to conspiracy theories that it had been created by the US, CIA, Mossad, or Hillary Clinton. The same happened after the rise of Boko Haram. 9/11 2001 attack on United States Main article: 9/11 conspiracy theories See also: 9/11 Truth movement and 9/11 Commission The attacks on the US by terrorists using hijacked aircraft on 11 September 2001 have proved attractive to conspiracy theorists. Theories may include reference to missile or hologram technology. The most common theory is that the Twin Towers collapsed in controlled demolitions, a theory rejected by the engineering profession and the 9/11 Commission. Sandy Hook school shooting in US 2012 Main article: Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories A 2012 fatal mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, prompted numerous conspiracy theories, among them the claim that it was a staged to promote gun control. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke blamed Zionist deception. Theorists such as Alex Jones have suggested that the event was staged with actors. Harassment of the bereaved families by conspiracy theorists has resulted in actions for defamation. Rush Limbaugh stated that the Mayan Calendar phenomenon drove the shooter Adam Lanza. Clintons Bill and Hillary Clinton, main people supposedly involved in this conspiracy The Clinton body count conspiracy theory, notably advanced by Newsmax publisher Christopher Ruddy, asserts that US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton have assassinated fifty or more of their associates and enemies. Such accusations have been around at least since the 1990s, when a pseudo-documentary film called The Clinton Chronicles, produced by Larry Nichols and promoted by Rev. Jerry Falwell, accused Bill Clinton of multiple crimes including murder. Jeffrey Epstein death conspiracy theories See also: Jeffrey Epstein death conspiracy theories The 2019 death of Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier billionaire and convicted sex offender with ties to Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and other members of the elite, has become the subject of conspiracy theories. FEMA Further information: FEMA camps conspiracy theory The United States' Federal Emergency Management Agency is the subject of many theories, including that the organization has been building concentration camps in the US to prepare for imposing martial law and genocide. African National Congress Members of South Africa's African National Congress party have long propagated conspiracy theories, frequently concerning the CIA and alleged white supremacists. In 2014, Deputy Minister of Defence Kebby Maphatsoe joined others in accusing without evidence Public Protector Thuli Madonsela of being a US agent working to create a puppet government in South Africa. Barack Obama See also: Spygate (conspiracy theory), False or misleading statements by Donald Trump, List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump, and Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories Donald Trump has been a proponent of the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Barack Obama has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. His presidency was the subject of a 2009 film, The Obama Deception, by Alex Jones, which alleged that Obama's administration was a puppet government for a wealthy elite. The \"birther\" theory, which came to prominence in 2009, denies the legitimacy of Obama's presidency by claiming that he was not born in the US. This theory has persisted despite his Hawaiian birth certificate and birth announcements in two Hawaiian newspapers in 1961. Notable promoters of the theory are dentist-lawyer Orly Taitz and former President Donald Trump, who has since publicly acknowledged its falsity but is said to continue to advocate for it privately. Other theories claim that Obama, a Protestant Christian, is secretly a Muslim. A pair of fatal attacks on US government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, by Islamist terrorists in 2012 has spawned numerous conspiracy theories, including allegations that Obama's administration arranged the attack for political reasons, and Senator Rand Paul's claimed that the government's response to the incident was designed to distract from a secret CIA operation. Cultural Marxism Further information: Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory The intellectual group known as the Frankfurt School, which emerged in the 1930s, has increasingly been accused of promoting communism in capitalist societies. The term \"Cultural Marxism\" has been notably employed by conservative American movements such as the Tea Party, and by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik. Deep state Further information: Deep state in the United States, List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump, and QAnon While the term is occasionally used as a neutral term to denote a nation's bureaucracy, the conspiratorial notion of a \"deep state\" originated principally in Middle Eastern and North African politics with some basis in truth, and has been known in the US since the 1960s. It was revived under the Trump presidency. \"Deep state\" in the latter sense refers to an unidentified insider \"power elite\" who manipulate a nation's politics and government. Proponents have included Canadian author Peter Dale Scott, who has promoted the idea in the US since the 1990s, as well as Breitbart News, Infowars and Donald Trump. A 2017 poll by ABC News and The Washington Post indicated that 48% of Americans believe in the existence of a conspiratorial \"deep state\" in the US. Sutherland Springs See also: Sutherland Springs church shooting § Hoaxes and conspiracy theories The 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting has also been the subject of multiple conspiracy theories. The shooter has been linked to multiple conspiracies, such as identifying him as a Democrat, Hillary Clinton supporter, Bernie Sanders supporter, \"alt-left\" supporter, antifa member, or radical Muslim; or claiming that he carried an antifa flag and told churchgoers: \"This is a communist revolution\". Some reports also falsely claimed that he targeted the church because they were white conservatives. Trump, Biden, and Ukraine Main article: Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal Beginning in 2017, a sprawling conspiracy theory emerged from 4chan and was spread via right-wing message boards and websites, then via Breitbart and Fox News to then-President Donald Trump and his allies. The conspiracy theory holds both that Ukraine (rather than Russia) had interfered in the 2016 United States elections, and that then-Vice President Joe Biden had intervened to protect a company in which his son Hunter was involved. The New Yorker found that reporting of the conspiracy in the right wing media was initiated by Peter Schweizer, a former Breitbart News contributor and president of The Government Accountability Institute, \"a self-styled corruption watchdog group chaired and funded by conservative mega-donor Rebekah Mercer\" and founded by Steve Bannon. Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory Main article: Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory Refers to a series of allegations that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden coordinated efforts against anti-corruption investigations in Ukraine into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, on whose Board Hunter Biden sat. Investigations are currently ongoing. Michelle Obama Some conservatives have supported a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that former FLOTUS, Michelle Obama, is secretly transgender, and that her name was originally \"Michael\". Alex Jones has been a vocal supporter of the theory, initially promoting it in 2014 after Joan Rivers made a joke referring to Obama as transgender. Ottoman and Turkish reforms, secularism, and statesmen Further information: Tanzimat, Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856, Young Ottomans, Young Turks, and Atatürk's reforms See also: War against Islam conspiracy theory His abolition of the caliphate and many other reforms that secularized Turkey made Atatürk the target of Islamist conspiracy theories. The belief that the modernist and secularist movements and reforms in the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic were Judeo-Masonic conspiracies is dominant among Islamists. Because of their adherence to traditionalist elements and their creation of cults of personality for the Ottoman sultans, Islamists portray anything contrary to Islamic tradition as evil. According to them, the constitutionalist movement ended absolute monarchy, the end of traditional religious institutions, and the introduction of a secular state were the work of Jews, Freemasons, or Dönmes. For example, according to their conspiracy theory, Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was a Dönme. Various conspiracy theories against Atatürk have been put forward by Islamist circles who did not support his secularist reforms. Kadir Mısıroğlu, known for his hatred of Atatürk, is behind many conspiracy theories about Atatürk. One of these conspiracy theories is that Anatolia was invaded by the Greeks as a result of Atatürk's agreement with the United Kingdom to overthrow the caliphate. Another conspiracy theory about Atatürk is that he was poisoned to death by the Freemasons due to the closure of Masonic lodges in Turkey in 1935. In 2015, Yeni Şafak claimed that İsmet İnönü was in charge of planning the murder. In 2007, the bestselling book in Turkey was Musa'nın Çocukları: Tayyip ve Emine (The Children of Moses: Tayyip and Emine) by Ergün Poyraz. Poyraz claims that there is an international Jewish conspiracy pulling the strings behind the world, including installing Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as prime minister of Turkey. Golden billion threatens Russia The golden billion is an idea there is an anti-Russian Western population of approximately one billion seeking to appropriate Russia's natural resources. It is a justification for Russian leader Vladimir Putin's imperial aggression, claiming to be a defense against a far-reaching covert attack. The theory was first advanced under the name A. Kuzmich. Voting pencils Main article: Voting pencil conspiracy theory The voting pencil conspiracy theory concerns pencils at polling places enabling electoral fraud through erasing legitimate votes. It has been nicknamed \"Pencilgate\" and promoted on Twitter as \"#Pencilgate\" and \"#UsePens\". The conspiracy theory originated in the United Kingdom and was originally promoted by \"Yes\" voters in the unsuccessful 2014 Scottish independence referendum, with supporters of Scottish independence (who usually lean to the left of the political spectrum) claiming that electoral fraud was the reason the referendum failed. However, the theory was later adopted by supporters of the \"Leave\" vote in the successful 2016 Brexit referendum (who usually lean to the right of the political spectrum). The conspiracy theory has since spread to Australia, with right-wing politician Pauline Hanson, a Queensland Senator who is the founder and leader of the One Nation party, promoted the conspiracy theory in the lead-up to the 2022 Australian federal election. While pencils are provided at polling places in the United Kingdom and Australia, in neither country is it required that they be used. On their website, the Australian Electoral Commission states: \"While the provision of pencils used to be a legal requirement, since 2020 under Section 206 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the AEC is required to provide an \"implement or method for voters to mark their ballot papers\". The AEC has found from experience that pencils are the most reliable implements for marking ballot papers. Pencils are practical because they don't run out and the polling staff check and sharpen pencils as necessary throughout election day. Pencils can be stored between elections and they work better in tropical areas. There is, however, nothing to prevent an elector from marking their ballot paper with a pen if they so wish.\" While the AEC only conducts federal elections, voters can use either pencil or pen in state, territory and local elections. Pencils are supplied at polling places for federal elections and for state elections in Tasmania and Victoria, while pens are supplied at polling places for state elections in New South Wales and Western Australia. In 2015, the New South Wales Electoral Commission made the decision to replace pencils with pens at polling places due to controversies regarding their usage and at the 2015 state election, pens began being supplied at polling places across the state. Similarly, the Western Australian Electoral Commission has provided pens instead of pencils at polling places since the 2017. QAnon Main article: QAnon QAnon is a far-right American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in 2017. QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Q\". Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers. Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, cannibalistic child molesters are operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump. QAnon has direct roots in Pizzagate, an Internet conspiracy theory that appeared one year earlier, but also incorporates elements of many other theories. QAnon has been described as a cult. State-sponsored kidnappings of Muslims in Sweden Main article: Alleged state-sponsored kidnappings of Muslims in Sweden Since December 2021, disinformation has been spread concerning Swedish social services taking Muslim children into care without a legal basis. As a result of the conspiracy theory, two Swedish people were killed in Brussels in 2023. Sustainable development Various theories have emerged in response to concepts or international agreements relating to sustainable development. These include theories that Agenda 21, a non-binding action plan of the United Nations, is a plot, disguised as an environmental movement, to end individual freedom and establish a one-world government to cut the world population by 85%, and/or to introduce surveillance by the 5G network. Similarly, the Great Reset Initiative is an economic recovery plan drawn up by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that prioritizes sustainable development. It has been the basis for theories that the COVID-19 pandemic will be used, or was even created by a secret group in order to seize control of the global economy. The urban planning concept of 15-minute cities envisages that all of life's necessities (e.g. work, shops, schools, medical centres) should be within a short walk or bike ride from people's homes. This would thereby encourage people to use their cars less and reduce emissions and pollution in neighbourhoods. However, it has been interpreted as a plan to restrict freedom of movement outside of the 15-minute neighbourhood. These theories occasionally overlap with anti-vaccine misinformation, and fears of a world government.

A prominent proponent of comparable conspiracy theories has been convicted fraudster Kevin Trudeau. Artificial diseases See also: HIV/AIDS denialism and Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic Scientists have found evidence that HIV was transferred from monkeys to humans in the 1930s. Evidence exists, however, that the KGB deliberately disseminated a notion in the 1980s that it was invented by the CIA. This idea, and similar ideas concerning Ebola, have since been promoted by persons such as actor Steven Seagal, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and former South Africa President Thabo Mbeki. Similar conspiracy theories allege that pharmaceutical companies assist in the creation of conditions and diseases including ADHD, HSV and HPV. COVID-19 pandemic Main article: Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic A number of conspiracy theories have been promoted about the origin and purported motive behind the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its spread. Some claimed that the virus was engineered, that it may have been a Chinese or United States bioweapon, a Jewish plot, part of which is to force mass vaccinations or sterilizations, spread as part of a Muslim conspiracy, a population control scheme, or related to 5G mobile phone networks. Fluoridation Ripper explains to Mandrake that he discovered the Communist plot to pollute Americans' \"precious bodily fluids\", a reference to the John Birch Society's anti-fluoridation conspiracy theories (Dr. Strangelove, 1964). Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay. Although many dental-health organizations support it, some conspiracy theorists claim that it was a way to dispose of industrial waste, or that it exists to obscure a failure to provide dental care to the poor. A further theory promoted by the John Birch Society in the 1960s described fluoridation as a communist plot to weaken the American population. Vaccination Further information: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump and List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump It is claimed that the pharmaceutical industry has mounted a cover-up of a causal link between vaccines and autism. The conspiracy theory developed after the publication in Britain in 1998 of a fraudulent paper by discredited former doctor Andrew Wakefield. The resulting anti-vaccine movement has been promoted by a number of prominent persons including Rob Schneider, Jim Carrey and former US President Donald Trump, and has led to increased rates of infection and death from diseases such as measles and COVID-19 in many countries, including the US, Italy, Germany, Romania and the UK. Vaccine conspiracy theories have been widespread in Nigeria since at least 2003, as well as in Pakistan. Such theories may feature claims that vaccines are part of a secret anti-Islam plot, and have been linked to fatal mass shootings and bombings at vaccine clinics in both countries. Outer space Scientific space programs are of particular interest to conspiracy theorists. The most prolific theories allege that the US moon landings were staged by NASA in a film studio, with some alleging the involvement of director Stanley Kubrick. The Soviet space program has also attracted theories that the government concealed evidence of failed flights. A more recent theory, emergent following the activities of hacker Gary McKinnon, suggests that a secret program of crewed space fleets exists, supposedly acting under the United Nations. Conspiracy theorists have long posited a plot by organizations such as NASA to conceal the existence of a large planet in the Solar System known as Nibiru or Planet X, which is alleged to pass close enough to the Earth to destroy it. Predictions for the date of destruction have included 2003, 2012 and 2017. The theory began to develop following the publication of The 12th Planet (1976), by Russian-American author Zecharia Sitchin, was given its full form by Nancy Lieder, and has since been promoted by American conspiracy theorist and End Times theorist David Meade. The notion received renewed attention during the period prior to the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017. Other conspiracy theorists in 2017 also predicted Nibiru would appear, including Terral Croft and YouTube pastor Paul Begley. Extraterrestrials and UFOs See also: UFO conspiracy theory Among the foremost concerns of conspiracy theorists are questions of alien life; for example, allegations of government cover-ups of the supposed Roswell UFO incident or activity at Area 51. Also disseminated are theories concerning so-called 'men in black', who allegedly silence witnesses.[citation needed] English conspiracy theorist David Icke Multiple reports of dead cattle found with absent body parts and seemingly drained of blood have emerged worldwide since at least the 1960s. This phenomenon has spawned theories variously concerning aliens and secret government or military experiments. Prominent among such theorists is Linda Moulton Howe, author of Alien Harvest (1989). Many conspiracy theories have drawn inspiration from the writings of ancient astronaut proponent Zecharia Sitchin, who declared that the Anunnaki from Sumerian mythology were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold. In his 1994 book Humanity's Extraterrestrial Origins: ET Influences on Humankind's Biological and Cultural Evolution, Arthur Horn proposed that the Anunnaki were a race of blood-drinking, shape-shifting alien reptiles. This theory was adapted and elaborated on by British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who maintains that the Bush family, Margaret Thatcher, Bob Hope, and the British Royal Family, among others, are or were such creatures, or have been under their control. Icke's critics have suggested that 'reptilians' may be seen as an antisemitic code word, a charge he has denied. Science and technology Climate change Further information: Climate change conspiracy theory Aerial view of the HAARP site, Alaska A climate change conspiracy theory typically alleges that the science behind climate change has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons—higher taxation, controls on lifestyle, and more authoritarian government. Former US President Donald Trump, US Senator James Inhofe, British journalist Christopher Booker, and Viscount Christopher Monckton have promoted such theories. Popular author Michael Crichton wrote a novel based on this premise. Weather and earthquake control projects Numerous theories pertain to real or alleged weather-controlling projects. Theories include the debunked assertion that HAARP, a radio-technology research program funded by the US government, is a secret weather-controlling system. Some theorists have blamed 2005's Hurricane Katrina on HAARP. HAARP has also been suggested to have somehow caused earthquakes, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami or the 2013 Saravan earthquake. Some HAARP-related claims refer to mind-control technology. Also of interest to conspiracy theorists are cloud-seeding technologies. These include a debunked allegation that the British military's Project Cumulus caused the fatal 1952 Lynmouth Flood in Devon, England, and claims concerning a secret project said to have caused the 2010 Pakistan floods. MKUltra Genuine American research in the 1950s and 1960s into chemical interrogation and mind-control techniques were followed by many conspiracy theories (like Project Monarch), especially following CIA Director Richard Helm's 1973 order to destroy all files related to the project. These theories include the allegation that the mass fatality at Jonestown in 1978 was connected to an MKUltra experiment. Flat Earth Logo of the Flat Earth Society, 2013 Flat Earth theory first emerged in 19th-century England, despite the Earth's spherical nature having been known since at least the time of Pythagoras. It has in recent years been promoted by American software consultant Mark Sargent through the use of YouTube videos. Flat-earther conspiracy theorists hold that planet Earth is not a sphere, and that evidence has been faked or suppressed to hide the fact that it is instead a disc, or a single infinite plane. The conspiracy often implicates NASA. Other claims include that GPS devices are rigged to make aircraft pilots wrongly believe they are flying around a globe. RFID chips An RFID tag, exposed by the damage to this Oyster card Radio frequency identification chips (RFID), such as those implanted into pets as a means of tracking, have drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists who posit that this technology is secretly widely implanted in humans. Former Whitby, England town councilor Simon Parkes has promoted this theory, which may be related to conspiracy theories concerning vaccination, electronic banking and the Antichrist. Technology suppression Numerous theories pertain to the alleged suppression of certain technologies and energies. Such theories may focus on the Vril Society Conspiracy, allegations of the suppression of the electric car by fossil-fuel companies (as detailed in the 2006 documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?), and the Phoebus cartel, set up in 1924, which has been accused of suppressing longer-lasting light bulbs. Other long-standing allegations include the suppression of perpetual motion and cold fusion technology by government agencies, special interest groups, or fraudulent inventors. Promoters of alternative energy theories have included Thomas Henry Moray, Eugene Mallove, and convicted American fraudster Stanley Meyer. Weaponry Conspiracy theorists often attend to new military technologies, both real and imagined. Subjects of theories include: the alleged Philadelphia Experiment, a supposed attempt to turn a US Navy warship invisible;[unreliable source?] the alleged Montauk Project, a supposed government program to learn about mind control and time travel; and the so-called \"tsunami bomb\", which is alleged to have caused the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Other theories include Peter Vogel's debunked claim that an accidental explosion of conventional munitions at Port Chicago was in fact a nuclear detonation, and a theory promoted by the Venezuelan state-run TV station ViVe that the 2010 Haiti earthquake was caused by a secret US \"earthquake weapon\". Targeted Individuals Further information: Gang stalking and Electronic harassment Conspiracy theorists claim that government agents are utilizing directed-energy weapons and electronic surveillance to harass members of the population. Theorists often cite research into psychotronic weapons, the Cuban Health Attacks, and the Microwave Auditory Effect as proof of their theory. There are over 10,000 people who identify as Targeted Individuals. The \"Targeted Individual\" phenomenon has been featured on episodes of Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura and History Channel's In Search of.... False history Pope Sylvester II (from 999 to 1003) Some theories claim that the dates of historical events have been deliberately distorted. These include the phantom time hypothesis of German conspiracy theorist Heribert Illig, who in 1991 published an allegation that 297 years had been added to the calendar by establishment figures such as Pope Sylvester II in order to position themselves at the millennium. A comparable theory, new chronology, is associated with Russian theorist Anatoly Fomenko, who holds that history is many centuries shorter than widely believed, numerous historical documents have been fabricated, and legitimate documents destroyed, all for political ends. Adherents of have included chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov. Another claim is that world governments have hidden evidence for an advanced worldwide civilization with access to free energy and partially populated by giants called Tartaria, which was destroyed in the 1800s by a great \"mud flood\" cataclysm, causing its remains to be buried. Dead Internet theory Main article: Dead Internet theory The Dead Internet theory is the belief that the modern Internet is almost entirely populated by bots and procedurally generated content. Sports Boxing Boxing has featured in conspiracy theories, such as the claims that the second Ali-Liston fight and the first Bradley-Pacquiao fight were fixed. Shergar The theft and disappearance of the Irish-bred racehorse Shergar in 1983 has prompted many conspiracy theorists to speculate about involvement by the Mafia, the IRA and Colonel Gaddafi. Rigged selection processes The \"frozen envelope theory\" suggests that the National Basketball Association rigged its 1985 draft lottery so that Patrick Ewing would join the New York Knicks. Theorists claim that a lottery envelope was chilled so that it could be identified by touch. A similar \"hot balls theory\", promoted by Scottish football manager David Moyes, suggests that certain balls used in draws for UEFA competitions have been warmed to achieve specific outcomes. 1984 Firecracker 400 The 1984 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona, Florida, was the first NASCAR race to be attended by a sitting US president, Ronald Reagan, and was driver Richard Petty's 200th and final career victory. Rival driver Cale Yarborough's premature retirement to the pit road has prompted conspiracy theorists to allege that organizers fixed the race in order to receive good publicity for the event. Ronaldo and the 1998 World Cup Final On the day of the 1998 World Cup Final, Brazilian striker Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit. Ronaldo was initially removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, with the teamsheet released to a stunned world media, before he was reinstated by the Brazil coach shortly before kick off. Ronaldo \"sleepwalked\" through the final, with France winning the game. The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations that persisted for years, with Alex Bellos writing in The Guardian, \"When Ronaldo's health scare was revealed after the match, the situation's unique circumstances lent itself to fabulous conspiracy theories. Here was the world's most famous sportsman, about to take part in the most important match of his career, when he suddenly, inexplicably, fell ill. Was it stress, epilepsy, or had he been drugged?\" Questions also circulated into who made Ronaldo play the game. The Brazil coach insisted he had the final say, but much speculation focused on sportswear company Nike, Brazil's multimillion-dollar sponsor—whom many Brazilians thought had too much control—putting pressure on the striker to play against medical advice. New England Patriots See also: New England Patriots § Controversies NRG Stadium before Super Bowl LI The New England Patriots have also been involved in numerous conspiracy theories. During their AFC Championship 24–20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, several conspiracy theories spread stating that the referees helped the Patriots advance to Super Bowl LII. However, sports analyst Stephen A. Smith stated the Jaguars were not robbed, but that they had no one to blame but themselves for the loss. There were also conspiracy theories regarding the Super Bowl LI matchup between the Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons stating that the game was rigged while others said the Falcons made questionable play-calls at the end of the game that resulted in them blowing a 28–3 lead.

The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica De Rocker/Alamy At the beginning of the 19th century, Charles IV, king of Spain, commissioned the preeminent artist Jacques-Louis David to commemorate Napoleon’s successful campaign against Austria at the Battle of Marengo with a painting. David’s finished work, Napoleon Crossing the Alps (1801), portrays the general sitting astride a rearing stallion on a rocky cliff. His hair and cape billow theatrically in the wind as he sternly gazes at the viewer and gestures toward the summit, apparently summoning his troops. When Napoleon saw the dashing portrait, he was flattered and commissioned David to paint three more just like it. Napoleon was no stranger to propaganda. He knew the importance of shaping, if not magnifying, his reputation, and among his efforts were censoring the French press when he was emperor and dictating his life story during his exile. Yet, there was one particularly pesky aspect of his legacy that Napoleon could not control: word that he was short. The rumor was rampant during his lifetime and persisted centuries after his death. In the 21st century, people may not be able to say exactly why Napoleon was so important, but they can usually say that he was short. Alas, the one thing everyone remembers about Napoleon probably isn’t even true! Napoleon was called Le Petit Caporal, but the nickname, translated as “The Little Corporal,” was not meant as a reflection of his stature. It was intended as a term of affection by his soldiers. Indeed, many contemporary French paintings, including David’s equestrian portrait, suggest that the general was not short but of average stature. In that painting he at least seems to be in proportion to his horse—but there are no other human figures nearby to which the viewer can refer. David’s other portraits of Napoleon don’t offer much by way of comparison either: in the majestic Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon and the Coronation of Empress Joséphine on December 2, 1804 (1806–07), the stepped platform from which Napoleon crowns his wife challenges any comparison with other figures, while The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries (1812) represents the subject standing alone at a desk. Works by contemporary artists show him similarly alone or sitting. One work by David’s student, Antoine-Jean Gros, however, offers a group of figures on the same plane with which to compare the general. Napoleon Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Stricken in Jaffa, March 11, 1799 (1804), commissioned by Napoleon, represents an episode from his Egyptian campaign in which he visited his plague-stricken troops in a makeshift hospital. By touching one of the victims, Napoleon defies the men around him, who hold handkerchiefs to their faces. He appears not only heroic but also average! All the men standing near him seem to be about the same height. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. The English, however, were not so generous: their artists depicted Napoleon as diminutive. Around 1803 the celebrated cartoonist James Gillray introduced the character of “Little Boney,” who resembled a childish Napoleon. At first, Gillray seemingly emphasized brattiness: in “Maniac ravings—or—Little Boney in a Strong fit,” Napoleon is shown in the midst of a tantrum, flipping furniture, wailing about the “British Nation” and “London Newspapers,” and shouting “Oh Oh Oh. Revenge! Revenge!” Gillray then played up juvenility through smallness, whereby Napoleon was represented wearing huge boots and, as one source put it, “trying to talk tough beneath an enormous bicorne hat dwarfing his entire body. Or struggling to pull a sword from an unwieldy scabbard that dragged along the ground as he walked.” Soon Napoleon was just depicted as being short. In “The Empress’s wish or Boney Puzzled!!” another cartoonist, Isaac Cruikshank, depicted a peevish Napoleon at about half the height of his wife and troops. A wee Bonaparte thus became the standard for representing the emperor in English newspapers. Though it’s hard to say if and why the British invented the short Napoleon trope, there is some truth in Cruikshank’s representation: Napoleon was probably significantly shorter than his troops. Several sources note that his elite guards were taller than most Frenchmen, and thus Napoleon had the appearance of being shorter than he really was. Yet interpretations of Napoleon’s death certificate estimate that his height when he died was between 5’2” and 5’7” (1.58 and 1.7 meters). The discrepancy is often explained by the disparity between the 19th-century French inch, which was 2.71 cm, and the current inch measurement, which is 2.54 cm. Sources consequently estimate that Napoleon was probably closer to 5’6” or 5’7” (1.68 or 1.7 meters) than to 5’2”. Although the range may seem short by 21st-century standards, it was typical in the 19th century, when most Frenchmen stood between 5’2” and 5’6” (1.58 and 1.68 meters) tall. Napoleon was thus average or taller, no matter the interpretation. Although Napoleon’s death certificate seems to suggest that he was probably taller than the typical 19th-century Frenchman, English cartoons, his nickname, and other hearsay left a lasting impression that the emperor was short. It was an impression that continued into the 21st century and one which no heroic painting by Jacques-Louis David could undo. Load More",

This was followed by paying for leisure activities such as going to a pub or restaurant (24%) and buying cleaning products (21%). More than three quarters of those who were unable to pay in cash said it an emotional impact on them. Most commonly this was frustration (44%), while 26% said the incident made them anxious and 23% found it to be embarrassing.

Your data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy policyMillions of people depend on cashSome 13% of respondents, equivalent to seven million people, told us that they regularly use cash and would struggle without it. Another 5% of people said that they depend on cash and would not be able to do the things they need to do without it. This equates to more than two and a half million people. If businesses refuse to take cash, they risk excluding these people, many of whom are among the most vulnerable in society. Some 53% of people said they had replaced some or all of their cash use since the first lockdown. Of these, 46% said that their declining cash use was as a result of shops prohibiting or discouraging it. 'My independence has been taken away'We heard many examples of the harm caused by being unable to pay in cash, including from Lucy* (pictured), from Oxford. Lucy has a chronic illness which left her essentially housebound for almost seven years. In the past year, she has built up her strength and stamina to the point where she can leave the house once a week, but Lucy says that being unable to use cash is making going out at increasingly difficult for her. 'If I had to do it all on card, I'd have to keep track of my spending while I'm out and I don't have the energy to do that. I wouldn't even bother going out - it would make it impossible.' 'It's taken years and years. Now, finally I'm well enough to get out of the house and it's like my independence has been taken away again.' Another concerning example came from James Boswell, from London. James is diabetic and was in urgent need of food after getting stuck in motorway traffic in November, but when he stopped at a service station, the first two restaurants he tried refused to serve him as he only had cash. He was eventually able to pay in cash at KFC. Cash provides 'a degree of control'Linda Blacker in Southampton and Joanne Heuston in Brighton contacted Which? Money after they were unable to pay for their bus fares in cash. Joanne attempted to pay with a £5 note, but the driver said he had no change. Linda was told the same thing when she attempted to pay with a banknote, despite having her foot in a brace as she had a broken ankle. She was on the way to see her GP to get a sick note. Linda says the driver was rude and unsympathetic, telling her she should get a contactless card instead. But for Linda, cash is an important budgeting tool: 'Quite a few years ago I was in a lot of debt. I've used cash ever since because I know exactly where I stand. It's what works for me.' Joanne says cash has helped her to manage the financial hardships of the pandemic. 'I was reduced to furlough payments and my husband, who works as a taxi driver, had no income whatsoever. So the way we managed our finances was that the money we left in the bank account was for bills and we withdrew the rest to live off so we could carefully control how we spent it'. Jane Tully, director of external affairs and partnerships at the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: 'We know that people on lower incomes are more likely to use cash. This can provide a degree of control for some people, particularly if they are on a very tight income, as that way they know where they are with their money week to week.' Are businesses legally obliged to take cash?We think it should be people's prerogative to pay with cash, whatever their reason for doing so. But there is no legal obligation for a business to accept it. It's the business owner's right to decide what payment methods they want to accept. Not everyone is aware of this, with confusion stemming from the fact that cash is often described as 'legal tender'. This doesn't mean it's your legal right to use it in a shop. In fact, the Bank of England says that legal tender has a 'narrow technical meaning' to do with paying debts and 'has no real use in everyday life'. However, with millions of people still reliant on or keen to use cash, it makes sense for businesses to make every effort to accept it. Is cash safe to use?Caution in the face of the pandemic is understandable, but just a few weeks into the first lockdown the Bank of England said the risk from banknotes is 'no greater than touching any other common surface, such as handrails, doorknobs or credit cards'. It cemented this position in November, by revealing the results of scientific research into the spread of germs on cash. The research concluded that 'any risk from handling cash should be low', particularly compared with 'high-touch' objects such as shopping baskets, self-checkout touchscreens or products for sale. This should reassure the 42% of shoppers who told us they were using less cash because they thought card payments were safer. The future of cashThe proportion of payments made in cash is falling. UK Finance says the figure halved from 46% to 23% between 2014 and 2019. But coins and notes are a long way from obsolete. Between the 5% of people who told us they rely on cash and the 13% who would struggle without it, that's 10 million people not ready - or able - to give up cash. That's not to mention the 22 million who say cash is an essential backup. Which? welcomesthe government's proposal for the FCA to be given the responsibility to oversee the protection of access to cash in the UK, but we are also calling on the government to make the regulator responsible for tracking the number of UK businesses accepting cash and the rate at which this is changing, in order to determine what action is needed and when. It's no good protecting people's access to cash if they have nowhere to spend it.

The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary between countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (one of the exceptions being England and Wales, which have a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places). Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcohol drinks. Youth rights Activities Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.

The most commonly known reason for the law behind the legal drinking age is the effect on the brain in adolescents. Since the brain is still maturing, alcohol can have a negative effect on the memory and long-term thinking. Alongside that, it can cause liver failure, and create a hormone imbalance in teens due to the constant changes and maturing of hormones during puberty. Some countries have a minimum legal drinking age of 19 to prevent the flow of alcoholic beverages in high schools, while others like the United States have a minimum legal purchasing age of 21 (18 in P.R. and USVI) in an effort to reduce the amount of drunk driving rates among teenagers and young adults. There is a concept called underage clubs, where individuals below the legal drinking age are catered for and are served non alcoholic beverages. Africa[edit] The most common minimum age to purchase alcohol in Africa is 18. However, Angola (except Luanda Province), Central African Republic, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali have no laws on the books restricting the sale of alcohol to minors.

Americas[edit] In Central America, the Caribbean, and South America the legal drinking age and legal purchase age varies from 0 to 20 years (see table below). In South America in particular, the legal purchase age is 18 years, with two exceptions: In Paraguay, the legal drinking age and purchase age is 20 years. In Guyana, minors aged 16 or 17 may consume a glass of beer or wine in a restaurant provided they buy a meal. In North America the legal drinking age and legal purchase age varies from 18 to 21 years: In Mexico, the drinking age is 18 in all states. In the United States, the minimum legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages is 21 years of age; the two exceptions are Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands where the age is 18. The legal drinking age varies by state, and many states have no age requirements for supervised drinking with one's parents or legal guardians. In Canada, most provinces have a minimum age of 19 years to buy or consume alcohol, while in Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec, the minimum age is 18 years. In the late 20th century, much of North America changed its minimum legal drinking ages (MLDAs) as follows: In the 1970s, provincial and state policy makers in Canada and the United States moved to lower MLDAs (which were set at 21 years in most provinces/territories and states) to coincide with the jurisdictional age of majority — typically 18 years of age.... As a result, MLDAs were reduced in all Canadian provinces [and] in more than half of US states. In Canada, however, two provinces, Ontario [in 1979] and Saskatchewan [in 1976], quickly raised their subsequent MLDAs from 18 to 19 years in response to a few studies demonstrating an association between the lowered drinking age and increases in alcohol-related harms to youth and young adults, including increases in motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and alcohol intoxication among high school students. Following MLDA reductions in the US, research in several states provided persuasive evidence of sharp increases in rates of fatal and nonfatal MVAs appearing immediately after the implementation of lower drinking ages. These scientific findings galvanized public pressure on lawmakers to raise MLDAs and, in response, the federal government introduced the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which imposed a reduction of highway funds for states if they did not increase their MLDA to 21 years. All states complied and implemented an MLDA of 21 years by 1988.

South Korea None 19 The age limit for alcohol is 19 calculated by the year of birth. This means that an 18-year-old will be legally allowed to purchase and consume alcohol if he or she will be turning 19 that year.

The method of calculating the legal age for alcohol slightly differs from Korean age reckoning in which another one year will be added to the person's age, whereas this method only doesn't take into account the month and day of birth but only the year instead. On June 28, 2023, the law that requires measuring age in the western way came into force. However, the previous system to determine the age to drink alcohol will be maintained.

Timeline of changes to drinking/purchase age or laws restricting the access to alcohol for minors: In 2002 the Spanish autonomous-communities Madrid, Valencia and Catalonia raised their minimum purchase age to 18 years. Previously, Valencia and Madrid had a minimum purchase age of 16 years, and in Catalonia minors aged 16 or 17 could purchase alcohol up to 23% ABV on- and off-premise. In 2004 Denmark raised its off-premise purchase age from 15 to 16 years. In November 2005 Switzerland passed its Food and Commodities Regulation (German: Lebensmittel- und Gebrauchsgegenständeverordnung), introducing a ban on alcohol sales to anyone under the age of 16. The Alcohol Law (German: Alkoholgesetz) passed in 1980 requires a minimum age of 18 years for the retail sale of distilled spirits. Therefore, it is prohibited to sell fermented alcohol (e.g. beer, wine, sparkling wine or cider) to anyone under the age of 16, and any distilled alcohol beverages to anyone under the age of 18 years. The canton of Ticino has a cantonal law since 1989 that makes the purchase age limit for all alcohol beverages 18 years.

In late 2006, Gibraltar lawmakers passed the Children and Young Persons (Alcohol, Tobacco and Gaming) Act 2006, which raised the minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 years. But the new law made an exception: minors aged 16 or 17 can purchase and consume beer, wine or cider under 15% ABV on-premise, and pre-packed containers of an alcohol strength not exceeding 5.5% ABV (e.g. alcopops). In 2009 France raised its minimum purchase age to 18 years, and fines were increased for selling or serving alcohol to a minor (up to €7,500). Previously, the minimum age was 16 years for off-premise and on-premise purchases of low-alcohol beverages (up to 3% ABV) such as wine, beer, cider, perry, mead, crème de cassis and juices from fermented fruits or vegetables that contain 1.2 to 3° alcohol, natural sweet wines from controlled cultivation and 18 for higher-ABV beverges.

Italy raised its minimum purchase age from 16 to 18 in 2012. Previously Italy did not have a purchase age for off-premise sales, and the minimum age of 16 years for on-premise sales was not well enforced. In 2013 the government of Portugal restricted alcohol sales to young people: distilled spirits cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18, and other alcohol beverages (e.g. beer, wine, or cider) cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 16. Previously the minimum age for all alcohol beverages was 16 years. As of 1 January 2014[update], the minimum legal purchase and consumption age was raised from 16 to 18 in the Netherlands. Previously young people over the age of 16 could purchase and consume alcohol beverages of <15% ABV, and those aged 18 and over could purchase all alcohol beverages. As of March 2015[update], the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias raised its drinking age from 16 to 18 years. Asturias was Spain's last community with a drinking age of 16 years. The new law brings the drinking age into line with the rest of Spain, with the exception of Balearic Islands where no purchase age limit is set. As of December 2015[update], Portugal harmonized its minimum drinking age to 18 years across all beverage types. Previously the purchase age was 16 years for low-alcohol beverages such as beer, wine or cider. As of 1 January 2018[update], Lithuania raised its minimum drinking age from 18 to 20 years. From January 2019 the federal states of Austria decided to align their drinking and purchase ages. The states Burgenland, Lower Austria and Vienna therefore raised their age limits for alcohol beverages containing spirits to 18. Prior to 2019 these states had a general drinking and purchase age of 16 years. The sale and consumption of beer, wine and other fermented alcohol beverages is now prohibited to children and young people under the age of 16 years, and the sale and consumption of spirits to minors under the age of 18 years is prohibited throughout Austria.

They have agreed by the treaties to share their own sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in certain aspects of government. State governments must agree unanimously in the Council for the union to adopt some policies; for others, collective decisions are made by qualified majority voting. These obligations and sharing of sovereignty within the EU (sometimes referred to as supranational) make it unique among international organisations, as it has established its own legal order which by the provisions of the founding treaties is both legally binding and supreme on all the member states (after a landmark ruling of the ECJ in 1964). A founding principle of the union is subsidiarity, meaning that decisions are taken collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually. Each member country appoints to the European Commission a European commissioner. The commissioners do not represent their member state, but instead work collectively in the interests of all the member states within the EU. In the 1950s, six core states founded the EU's predecessor European Communities (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. To accede, a state must fulfil the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic government and free-market economy together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire. The United Kingdom, which had acceded to the EU's predecessor in 1973, ceased to be an EU member state on 31 January 2020, in a political process known as Brexit. No other member state has withdrawn from the EU and none has been suspended, although some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas have left.

EU15 includes the fifteen countries in the European Union from 1 January 1995 to 1 May 2004. The EU15 comprised Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Eurostat still uses this expression. EU19 includes the countries in the EU15 as well as the Central European member countries of the OECD: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovak Republic. EU11 is used to refer to the Central, Southeastern Europe and Baltic European member states that joined in 2004, 2007 and 2013: in 2004 the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia; in 2007 Bulgaria, Romania; and in 2013 Croatia. EU27 means all the member states. It was originally used in this sense from 2007 until Croatia's accession in 2013, and during the Brexit negotiations from 2017 until the United Kingdom's withdrawal on 31 January 2020 it came to mean all members except the UK. EU28 meant all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020. Additionally, other abbreviations have been used to refer to countries which had limited access to the EU labour market. A8 is eight of the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia. A2 is the countries that joined the EU in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania. Changes in membership[edit] Enlargement[edit] See also: Enlargement of the European Union, Potential enlargement of the European Union, and Brexit Member states of the European Union (dark blue) (1993–present). Pre-1993, the EU was known as the European Communities (sky blue). Animated in order of accession and secession. According to the Copenhagen criteria, membership of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, free-market liberal democracy that respects the rule of law and human rights. Furthermore, it has to be willing to accept all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of acquis communautaire) and switching to the euro. For a state to join the European Union, the prior approval of all current member states is required. In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below). Suspension[edit] Main article: Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union There is no provision to expel a member state, but TEU Article 7 provides for the suspension of certain rights. Introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 7 outlines that if a member persistently breaches the EU's founding principles (liberty, democracy, human rights and so forth, outlined in TEU Article 2) then the European Council can vote to suspend any rights of membership, such as voting and representation. Identifying the breach requires unanimity (excluding the state concerned), but sanctions require only a qualified majority. The state in question would still be bound by the obligations treaties and the Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions. The Treaty of Nice included a preventive mechanism whereby the council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above. However, the treaties do not provide any mechanism to expel a member state outright. Withdrawal[edit] Main article: Withdrawal from the European Union Prior to the Lisbon Treaty there was no provision or procedure within any of the Treaties of the European Union for a member state to withdraw from the European Union or its predecessor organisations. The Lisbon Treaty changed this and included the first provision and procedure of a member state to leave the bloc. The procedure for a state to leave is outlined in TEU Article 50 which also makes clear that \"Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements\". Although it calls for a negotiated withdrawal between the seceding state and the rest of the EU, if no agreement is reached two years after the seceding state notifying of its intention to leave, it would cease to be subject to the treaties anyway (thus ensuring a right to unilateral withdrawal). There is no formal limit to how much time a member state can take between adopting a policy of withdrawal, and actually triggering Article 50.[citation needed] In a non-binding referendum in June 2016—the result of which the government promised to implement—the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU. The UK government triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017. After an extended period of negotiation and internal political debate the United Kingdom eventually withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020 concluding the first phase of the Brexit process. Prior to 2016, no member state had voted to withdraw. However, French Algeria, Greenland and Saint-Barthélemy did cease being part of the EU (or its predecessor) in 1962, 1985, and 2012, respectively, due to status changes. The situation of Greenland being outside the EU while still subject to an EU member state had been discussed as a template for the pro-EU regions of the UK remaining within the EU or its single market. Beyond the formal withdrawal of a member state, there are a number of independence movements such as Catalonia or Flanders which could result in a similar situation to Greenland. Were a territory of a member state to secede but wish to remain in the EU, some scholars claim it would need to reapply to join as if it were a new country applying from scratch. However, other studies claim internal enlargement is legally viable if, in case of a member state dissolution or secession, the resulting states are all considered successor states. There is also a European Citizens' Initiative that aims at guaranteeing the continuity of rights and obligations of the European citizens belonging to a new state arising from the democratic secession of a European Union member state. As of 2024, the United Kingdom is the only former member state. The government of the United Kingdom formally initiated the process of the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 29 March 2017 by triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on the EU, following a June 2016 referendum. The withdrawal was scheduled in law to occur on 29 March 2019. Subsequently, the UK sought, and was granted, a number of Article 50 extensions until 31 January 2020. On 23 January 2020, the Withdrawal agreement was ratified by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and on 29 January 2020 by the European Parliament. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 at 23:00 GMT, ending 47 years of membership. Representation[edit] A 2011 'family photo' of the European Council, which comprises the heads of state or government of the member states, along with President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission Each state has representation in the institutions of the European Union. Full membership gives the government of a member state a seat in the Council of the European Union and European Council. When decisions are not being taken by consensus, qualified majority voting (which requires majorities both of the number of states and of the population they represent, but a sufficient blocking minority can veto the proposal). The Presidency of the Council of the European Union rotates among each of the member states, allowing each state six months to help direct the agenda of the EU. Similarly, each state is assigned seats in Parliament according to their population (smaller countries receiving more seats per inhabitant than the larger ones). The members of the European Parliament have been elected by universal suffrage since 1979 (before that, they were seconded from national parliaments). The national governments appoint one member each to the European Commission, the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors. Prospective Commissioners must be confirmed both by the President of the Commission and by the European Parliament; prospective justices must be confirmed by the existing members. Historically, larger member states were granted an extra Commissioner. However, as the body grew, this right has been removed and each state is represented equally. The six largest states are also granted an Advocates General in the Court of Justice. Finally, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank includes the governors of the national central banks (who may or may not be government appointed) of each euro area country. The larger states traditionally carry more weight in negotiations, however smaller states can be effective impartial mediators and citizens of smaller states are often appointed to sensitive top posts to avoid competition between the larger states. This, together with the disproportionate representation of the smaller states in terms of votes and seats in parliament, gives the smaller EU states a greater power of influence than is normally attributed to a state of their size. However most negotiations are still dominated by the larger states. This has traditionally been largely through the \"Franco-German motor\" but Franco-German influence has diminished slightly following the influx of new members in 2004 (see G6). Sovereignty[edit] Article 4 In accordance with Article 5, competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the member states. The Union shall respect the equality of member states before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each member state. Pursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation, the Union and the member states shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties. The member states shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. The member states shall facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the Union's objectives. – Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union While the member states are sovereign, the union partially follows a supranational system for those functions agreed by treaty to be shared. (\"Competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the member states\"). Previously limited to European Community matters, the practice, known as the 'community method', is currently used in many areas of policy. Combined sovereignty is delegated by each member to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions. This practice is often referred to as 'pooling of sovereignty'. Those institutions are then empowered to make laws and execute them at a European level. If a state fails to comply with the law of the European Union, it may be fined or have funds withdrawn. In contrast to some international organisations, the EU's style of integration as a union of states does not \"emphasise sovereignty or the separation of domestic and foreign affairs [and it] has become a highly developed system for mutual interference in each other's domestic affairs, right down to beer and sausages.\". However, on defence and foreign policy issues (and, pre-Lisbon Treaty, police and judicial matters) less sovereignty is transferred, with issues being dealt with by unanimity and co-operation. Very early on in the history of the EU, the unique state of its establishment and pooling of sovereignty was emphasised by the Court of Justice: By creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality, its own legal capacity and capacity of representation on the international plane and, more particularly, real powers stemming from a limitation of sovereignty or a transfer of powers from the States to Community, the Member States have limited their sovereign rights and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves...The transfer by the States from their domestic legal system to the Community legal system of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries with it a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights. — European Court of Justice 1964, in reference to case of Costa v ENEL The question of whether Union law is superior to State law is subject to some debate. The treaties do not give a judgement on the matter but court judgements have established EU's law superiority over national law and it is affirmed in a declaration attached to the Treaty of Lisbon (the proposed European Constitution would have fully enshrined this). The legal systems of some states also explicitly accept the Court of Justice's interpretation, such as France and Italy, however in Poland it does not override the state's constitution, which it does in Germany.[citation needed] The exact areas where the member states have given legislative competence to the Union are as follows. Every area not mentioned remains with member states. Competences[edit] See also: subsidiarity In EU terminology, the term 'competence' means 'authority or responsibility to act'. The table below shows which aspects of governance are exclusively for collective action (through the commission) and which are shared to a greater or lesser extent. If an aspect is not listed in the table below, then it remains the exclusive competence of the member state. Perhaps the best known example is taxation, which remains a matter of state sovereignty.

As a result of the Greek government-debt crisis, Greece accepted a large austerity plan including privatisations and a sell off of state assets in exchange for their bailout. To ensure that Greece complied with the conditions set by the European troika (ECB, IMF, Commission), a 'large-scale technical assistance' from the European Commission and other member states was deployed to Greek government ministries. Some, including the President of the Euro Group Jean-Claude Juncker, stated that \"the sovereignty of Greece will be massively limited.\" The situation of the bailed out countries (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) has been described as being a ward or protectorate of the EU with some such as the Netherlands calling for a formalisation of the situation. Multi-speed integration[edit] Main article: European integration § Multi-speed Europe See also: Enhanced cooperation and Opt-outs in the European Union EU integration is not always symmetrical, with some states proceeding with integration ahead of hold-outs. There are several different forms of closer integration both within and outside the EU's normal framework. One mechanism is enhanced cooperation where nine or more states can use EU structures to progress in a field that not all states are willing to partake in. Some states have gained an opt-out in the founding treaties from participating in certain policy areas. Political systems[edit] For a more comprehensive list, see List of European Union member states by political system. presidential republic semi-presidential republic parliamentary republic parliamentary constitutional monarchy The admission of a new state the Union is limited to liberal democracies and Freedom House ranks all EU states as being totally free electoral democracies. All but 4 are ranked at the top 1.0 rating. However, the exact political system of a state is not limited, with each state having its own system based on its historical evolution. More than half of member states—16 out of 27—are parliamentary republics, while six states are constitutional monarchies, meaning they have a monarch although political powers are exercised by elected politicians. Most republics and all the monarchies operate a parliamentary system whereby the head of state (president or monarch) has a largely ceremonial role with reserve powers. That means most power is in the hands of what is called in most of those countries the prime minister, who is accountable to the national parliament. Of the remaining republics, four[clarification needed] operate a semi-presidential system, where competences are shared between the president and prime minister, while one republic operates a presidential system, where the president is head of both state and government. Parliamentary structure in member states varies: there are 15 unicameral national parliaments and 12 bicameral parliaments. The prime minister and government are usually directly accountable to the directly elected lower house and require its support to stay in office—the exceptions being Cyprus and France with their presidential systems. Upper houses are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the Polish senate; indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the Federal Council of Austria; or unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the National Council of Slovenia. All elections in member states use some form of proportional representation. The most common type of proportional representation is the party-list system.[citation needed] There are also differences in the level of self-governance for the sub-regions of a member state. Most states, especially the smaller ones, are unitary states; meaning all major political power is concentrated at the national level. 9 states allocate power to more local levels of government. Austria, Belgium and Germany are full federations, meaning their regions have constitutional autonomies. Denmark, Finland, France and the Netherlands are federacies, meaning some regions have autonomy but most do not. Spain and Italy have systems of devolution where regions have autonomy, but the national government retains the legal right to revoke it. States such as France have a number of overseas territories, retained from their former empires.

Although the latter was later, it is more often considered the immediate predecessor to the EU. The former has always shared the same membership and has since been absorbed by the EU, which was formally established in 1993.

Etymology[edit] Origins of the term extraterrestrial hypothesis are unknown, but use in printed material on UFOs seems to date to at least the latter half of the 1960s. French ufologist Jacques Vallée used it in his 1966 book Challenge to science: the UFO enigma. It was used in a publication by French engineer Aimé Michel in 1967, by James E. McDonald in a symposium in March 1968 and again by McDonald and James Harder while testifying before the Congressional Committee on Science and Astronautics, in July 1968. Skeptic Philip J. Klass used it in his 1968 book UFOs--Identified. In 1969 physicist Edward Condon defined the \"extraterrestrial hypothesis\" or \"ETH\" as the \"idea that some UFOs may be spacecraft sent to Earth from another civilization or space other than Earth, or on a planet associated with a more distant star,\" while presenting the findings of the much debated Condon Report. Some UFO historians credit Condon with popularizing the term and its abbreviation \"ETH.\" Chronology[edit] Although the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) as a phrase is a comparatively new concept, one which owes much to the flying saucer sightings of the 1940s–1960s, its origins can be traced back to a number of earlier events, such as the now-discredited Martian canals and ancient Martian civilization promoted by astronomer Percival Lowell, popular culture including the writings of H. G. Wells and fellow science fiction pioneers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, who likewise wrote of Martian civilizations, and even to the works of figures such as the Swedish philosopher, mystic and scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, who promoted a variety of unconventional views that linked other worlds to the afterlife. In the early part of the twentieth century, Charles Fort collected accounts of anomalous physical phenomena from newspapers and scientific journals, including many reports of extraordinary aerial objects. These were published in 1919 in The Book of the Damned. In this and two subsequent books, New Lands (1923) and Lo! (1931), Fort theorized that visitors from other worlds were observing Earth. Fort's reports of aerial phenomena were frequently cited in American newspapers when the UFO phenomenon first attracted widespread media attention in June and July 1947. The modern ETH—specifically, the implicit linking of unidentified aircraft and lights in the sky to alien life—took root during the late 1940s and took its current form during the 1950s. It drew on pseudoscience, as well as popular culture. Unlike earlier speculation of extraterrestrial life, interest in the ETH was also bolstered by many unexplained sightings investigated by the U.S. government and governments of other countries, as well as private civilian groups, such as NICAP and APRO. Historical reports of extraterrestrial visits[edit] An early example of speculation over extraterrestrial visitors can be found in the French newspaper Le Pays, which on June 17, 1864, published a story about two American geologists who had allegedly discovered an alien-like creature, a mummified three-foot-tall hairless humanoid with a trunk-like appendage on its forehead, inside a hollow egg-shaped structure. H. G. Wells, in his 1898 science fiction classic The War of the Worlds, popularized the idea of Martian visitation and invasion. Even before Wells, there was a sudden upsurge in reports in \"Mystery airships\" in the United States. For example, The Washington Times in 1897 speculated that the airships were \"a reconnoitering party from Mars\", and the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch wrote: \"these may be visitors from Mars, fearful, at the last, of invading the planet they have been seeking.\" Later, there was a more international airship wave from 1909-1912. An example of an extraterrestrial explanation at the time was a 1909 letter to a New Zealand newspaper suggesting \"atomic powered spaceships from Mars.\" From the 1920s, the idea of alien visitation in space ships was commonplace in popular comic strips and radio and movie serials, such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. In particular, the Flash Gordon serials have the Earth being attacked from space by alien meteors, ray beams, and biological weapons. In 1938, a radio broadcast version of The War of the Worlds by Orson Welles, using a contemporary setting for H. G. Wells' Martian invasion, created some public panic in the United States. The 1947 flying saucer wave in America[edit] On June 24, 1947, at about 3:00 p.m. local time, pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine unidentified disk-shaped aircraft flying near Mount Rainier. When no aircraft emerged that seemed to account for what he had seen, Arnold quickly considered the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial. On July 7, 1947, two stories came out where Arnold was raising the topic of possible extraterrestrial origins, both as his opinion and those who had written to him. In an Associated Press story, Arnold said he had received quantities of fan mail eager to help solve the mystery. Some of them \"suggested the discs were visitations from another planet.\" When the 1947 flying saucer wave hit the United States, there was much speculation in the newspapers about what they might be in news stories, columns, editorials, and letters to the editor. For example, on July 10, U.S. Senator Glen Taylor of Idaho commented, \"I almost wish the flying saucers would turn out to be space ships from another planet,\" because the possibility of hostility \"would unify the people of the earth as nothing else could.\" On July 8, R. DeWitt Miller was quoted by UP saying that the saucers had been seen since the early nineteenth century. If the present discs weren't secret Army weapons, he suggested they could be vehicles from Mars, or other planets, or maybe even \"things out of other dimensions of time and space.\" Other articles brought up the work of Charles Fort, who earlier in the twentieth century had documented numerous reports of unidentified flying objects that had been written up in newspapers and scientific journals. Even if people thought the saucers were real, most were generally unwilling to leap to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial in origin. Various popular theories began to quickly proliferate in press articles, such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, optical illusions, and mass hysteria. According to journalist Edward R. Murrow, the ETH as a serious explanation for \"flying saucers\" did not earn widespread attention until about 18 months after Arnold's sighting. These attitudes seem to be reflected in the results of the first U.S. poll of public UFO perceptions released by Gallup on August 14, 1947. The term \"flying saucer\" was familiar to 90% of the respondents. As to what people thought explained them, the poll further showed, that most people either held no opinion or refused to answer the question (33%), or generally believed that there was a mundane explanation. 29% thought they were optical illusions, mirages, or imagination; 15% a U.S. secret weapon; 10% a hoax; 3% a \"weather forecasting device\"; 1% of Soviet origin, and 9% had \"other explanations,\" including fulfillment of Biblical prophecy, secret commercial aircraft, or phenomena related to atomic testing. U.S. military investigation and debunkery[edit] On July 9, Army Air Forces Intelligence began a secret study of the best saucer reports, including that of Arnold's. A follow-up study by the Air Materiel Command intelligence and engineering departments at Wright Field, Ohio led to the formation of the U.S. Air Force's Project Sign at the end of 1947, the first official U.S. military UFO study. In 1948, Project Sign concluded without endorsing any unified explanation for all UFO reports, and the ETH was rejected by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg, citing a lack of physical evidence. Vandenberg dismantled Project Sign, and with this official policy in place, subsequent public Air Force reports concluded, that there was insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation of UFOs.[citation needed] In 1952, Life Magazine published \"Have We Visitors From Space?\" which popularized the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis and is thought to have triggered the 1952 UFO flap. Immediately following the great UFO wave of 1952 and the military debunking of radar and visual sightings, plus jet interceptions over Washington, D.C. in August, the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation took particular interest in UFOs. Though the ETH was mentioned, it was generally given little credence. However, others within the CIA, such as the Psychological Strategy Board, were more concerned about how an unfriendly power such as the Soviet Union might use UFOs for psychological warfare purposes, exploit the gullibility of the public for the sensational, and clog intelligence channels. Under a directive from the National Security Council to review the problem, in January 1953, the CIA organized the Robertson Panel, a group of scientists who quickly reviewed the Blue Book's best evidence, including motion pictures and an engineering report that concluded that the performance characteristics were beyond that of earthly craft. After two days' review, all cases were claimed to have conventional explanations. An official policy of public debunkery was recommended using the mass media and authority figures in order to influence public opinion and reduce the number of UFO reports. Evolution of public opinion[edit] The early 1950s also saw a number of movies depicting flying saucers and aliens, including The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), The War of the Worlds (1953), Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), and Forbidden Planet (1956). A poll published in Popular Science magazine in August 1951 reported that of the respondents who self-reported as UFO witnesses, 52% believed that they had seen a man-made aircraft, while only 4% believed that they had seen an alien craft; an additional 28% were uncertain, with more than half of these stating they believed they were either man-made aircraft, or \"visitors from afar.\" By 1957, 25% of Americans responded that they either believed, or were willing to believe in the ETH, while 53% responded that they were not. 22% reported that they were uncertain.[failed verification] A Roper poll in 2002 reported that 56% of respondents thought UFOs were real, with 48% believing that UFOs had visited Earth. Religion[edit] Further information: Exotheology Fewer sightings despite camera phone technology[edit] As the proliferation of smartphone camera technology across the population has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings, the claimed phenomenology of UFOs has been called into question. This goes counter to the predictions of supporters of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, even causing a crisis of confidence among some within the informal UFO research community. Involvement of scientists[edit] The scientific community has shown very little support for the ETH, and has largely accepted the explanation that reports of UFOs are the result of people misinterpreting common objects or phenomena, or are the work of hoaxers. Professor Stephen Hawking has expressed skepticism about the ETH. In a 1969 lecture, U.S. astrophysicist Carl Sagan said: \"The idea of benign or hostile space aliens from other planets visiting the Earth [is clearly] an emotional idea. There are two sorts of self-deception here: either accepting the idea of extraterrestrial visitation by space aliens in the face of very meager evidence because we want it to be true; or rejecting such an idea out of hand, in the absence of sufficient evidence, because we don't want it to be true. Each of these extremes is a serious impediment to the study of UFOs.\" Similarly, British astrophysicist Peter A. Sturrock wrote \"for many years, discussions of the UFO issue have remained narrowly polarized between advocates and adversaries of a single theory, namely the extraterrestrial hypothesis ... this fixation on the ETH has narrowed and impoverished the debate, precluding an examination of other possible theories for the phenomenon.\" An informal poll done by Sturrock in 1973 of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics members found that about 10% of them believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space.[failed verification][failed verification] In another informal poll conducted in 1977 by astrophysicist Peter A. Sturrock, he surveyed members of the American Astronomical Society. Sturrock asked polled scientists to assign probabilities to eight possible explanations for UFOs. The results were:[failed verification] 23% An unfamiliar natural phenomenon 22% A familiar phenomenon or device 21% An unfamiliar terrestrial device 12% Hoax 9% An unknown natural phenomenon 7% Some specifiable other cause 3% An alien device 3% Some unspecified other cause The primary scientific arguments against ETH were summarized by astronomer and UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek during a presentation at the 1983 MUFON Symposium, where he outlined seven key reasons why he could not accept the ETH. Failure of sophisticated surveillance systems to detect incoming or outgoing UFOs Gravitational and atmospheric considerations Statistical considerations Elusive, evasive and absurd behavior of UFOs and their occupants Isolation of the UFO phenomenon in time and space: the Cheshire Cat effect The space unworthiness of UFOs The problem of astronomical distances Hynek argued that: Despite worldwide radar systems and Earth-orbiting satellites, UFOs are alleged to flit in and out of the atmosphere, leaving little to no evidence. Space aliens are alleged to be overwhelmingly humanoid, and are allegedly able to exist on Earth without much difficulty often lacking \"space suits\", even though extra-solar planets would likely have different atmospheres, biospheres, gravity and other factors, and extraterrestrial life would likely be very different from Earthly life. The number of reported UFOs and of purported encounters with UFO-inhabitants outstrips the number of expeditions that an alien civilization (or civilizations) could statistically be expected to mount. The behavior of extraterrestrials reported during alleged abductions is often inconsistent and irrational. UFOs are isolated in time and space: like the Cheshire Cat, they seem to appear and disappear at will, leaving only vague, ambiguous and mocking evidence of their presence Reported UFOs are often far too small to support a crew traveling through space, and their reported flight behavior is often not representative of a craft under intelligent control (erratic flight patterns, sudden course changes). The distance between planets makes interstellar travel impractical, particularly because of the amount of energy that would be required for interstellar travel using conventional means, (According to a NASA estimate, it would take 7×1019 joules of energy to send the then-current Space Shuttle on a one-way 50-year journey to the nearest star, an enormous amount of energy) and because of the level of technology that would be required to circumvent conventional energy/fuel/speed limitations using exotic means, such as Einstein-Rosen Bridges as ways to shorten distances from point A to point B. (see Faster-than-light travel). According to the personal assessment of Hynek at the time, points 1 through 6 could be argued, but point 7 represented an \"insurmountable\" barrier to the validity of the ETH. Recent support[edit] Others have argued that (unless mechanisms of repulse or dissolution and/or data-manipulation and/or cloaking technologies are and remain sufficiently deployed to prevent this),[additional citation(s) needed] self-replicating spacecraft or their communications networks could potentially be detectable within our Solar system or in nearby star-based systems, if they are located there. Other research has since also addressed earlier arguments about the distance-related bottleneck with potential solutions other civilizations may have developed such as embryo space colonization and Alcubierre drives. A 2021 scientific review concluded there to be robust rationale for organizing missions for searching artifacts – including probes – within the Solar system. The sentiment in the scientific community about the extraterrestrial hypothesis in relation to UFO reports and data shifted substantially after serious news reports about the topic by large media outlets within the U.S. and Canada and a public debate including former and present public servants in anticipation of a report by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. During this change of attitude in early summer 2021, still small but increasing numbers of scientists first began to publicly discuss UFOs and systematic investigations of them in a sober manner on large platforms. NASA[edit] NASA frequently fields questions in regard to the ETH and UFOs. As of 2006, its official standpoint was that ETH has a lack of empirical evidence. \"no one has ever found a single artifact, or any other convincing evidence for such alien visits\". David Morrison. \"As far as I know, no claims of UFOs as being alien craft have any validity -- the claims are without substance, and certainly not proved\". David Morrison Despite public interest, up until 2021, NASA had considered the study of ETH to be irrelevant to its work because of the number of false leads that a study would provide, and the limited amount of usable scientific data that it would yield. [citation needed] On the History Channel UFO Hunters episode \"The NASA Files\" (2008), Former NASA astronauts have commented; Gordon Cooper wrote that NASA and the government \"swept these and other sightings under the rug\". Brian O'Leary stated \"some of my fellow astronauts and scientists astronauts that did go up and who have observed things, very clearly, they were told - not to report it\". In June 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced that he had directed NASA scientists to investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon. During an interview at the University of Virginia, Bill Nelson explored the possibility that UAP could represent extraterrestrial technology. NASA scientist Ravi Kopparapu advocates studying UAP. We need to frame the current UAP/UFO question with the same level of active inquiry, one involving experts from academia in disciplines including astronomy, meteorology and physics, as well as industry and government professionals with knowledge of military aircraft, remote sensing from the ground and satellite observations. Participants would need to be agnostic toward any specific explanations with a primary goal of collecting enough data — including visual, infrared, radar and other possible observations — to eventually allow us to deduce the identity of such UAP. Following this agnostic approach, and relying upon sound scientific and peer-reviewed methods, would go a long way toward lifting the taboo in mainstream science. In August 2021, at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Aviation, Kopparapu presented a paper from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 134th Meeting General Symposium that supported ETH. Kopparapu stated he and his colleagues found the paper \"perfectly credible\". Conspiracy theories[edit] Main article: UFO conspiracy theory A frequent concept in ufology and popular culture is that the true extent of information about UFOs is being suppressed by some form of conspiracy of silence, or by an official cover-up that is acting to conceal information. In 1968, American engineer James Harder argued that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs \"beyond reasonable doubt,\" but that the evidence had been suppressed and largely neglected by scientists and the general public, thus preventing sound conclusions from being reached on the ETH. \"Over the past 20 years a vast amount of evidence has been accumulating that bears on the existence of UFOs. Most of this is little known to the general public or to most scientists. But on the basis of the data and ordinary rules of evidence, as would be applied in civil or criminal courts, the physical reality of UFOs has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" J A Harder A survey carried out by Industrial Research magazine in 1971 showed that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs (76%) than believed in the existence of UFOs (54%), or in ETH itself (32%).[failed verification] People have had a long-standing curiosity about extraterrestrial life. Aliens are the subject of numerous urban legends, including claims that they have long been present on earth or that they may be able to assist humans in resolving certain issues. Despite these myths, the truth is that there is no scientific proof to back up these assertions, hence we cannot declare with certainty whether or not aliens exist. Documents and investigations regarding ETH[edit] Other private or government studies, some secret, have concluded in favor of the ET hypothesis, or have had members who disagreed in contravention with official conclusions reached by the committees and agencies to which they belonged. The following are examples of sources that have focused specifically on the topic: In 1967, Greek physicist Paul Santorini, a Manhattan Project scientist, publicly stated that a 1947 Greek government investigation into the European Ghost rockets of 1946 under his lead quickly concluded that they were not missiles. Santorini claimed the investigation was then quashed by military officials from the U.S., who knew them to be extraterrestrial, because there was no defense against the advanced technology and they feared widespread panic should the results become public. November 1948 USAF Top Secret document citing extraterrestrial opinion. A 1948 Top Secret USAF Europe document (at right) states that Swedish air intelligence informed them that at least some of their investigators into the ghost rockets and flying saucers concluded they had extraterrestrial origins: \"...Flying saucers have been reported by so many sources and from such a variety of places that we are convinced that they cannot be disregarded and must be explained on some basis which is perhaps slightly beyond the scope of our present intelligence thinking. When officers of this Directorate recently visited the Swedish Air Intelligence Service... their answer was that some reliable and fully technically qualified people have reached the conclusion that 'these phenomena are obviously the result of a high technical skill which cannot be credited to any presently known culture on earth.' They are therefore assuming that these objects originate from some previously unknown or unidentified technology, possibly outside the earth.\" In 1948, the USAF Project Sign produced a Top Secret Estimate of the Situation, concluding that the ETH was the most likely explanation for the most perplexing unexplained cases. The study was ordered destroyed by USAF Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg, citing lack of proof. Knowledge of the existence of the Estimate has come from insiders who said they read a surviving copy, including the later USAF Project Blue Book head Edward J. Ruppelt, and astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek. West Germany, in conjunction with other European countries, conducted a secret study from 1951 to 1954, also concluding that UFOs were extraterrestrial. This study was revealed by German rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth, who headed the study and who also made many public statements supporting the ETH in succeeding years. At the study's conclusion in 1954, Oberth declared: \"These objects (UFOs) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. They do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not in our galaxy.\" Soon afterwards, in an October 24, 1954, article in The American Weekly, Oberth wrote: \"It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system. I think that they possibly are manned by intelligent observers who are members of a race that may have been investigating our earth for centuries...\" The CIA started their own internal scientific review the following day.[when?] Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added: \"...as long as a series of reports remains 'unexplainable' (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject.\" A report from later that month[when?] was similarly skeptical, but nevertheless concluded: \"...sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, at a time when the background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even 'blue yonder' explanations that might be tenable, and we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers.\" A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: \"...the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation [sic] are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.\" Some of the memos also made it clear, that CIA interest in the subject was not to be made public, partly in fear of possible public panic. (Good, 331–335) The CIA organized the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk the data collected by the Air Force's Project Blue Book. This included an engineering analysis of UFO maneuvers by Blue Book (including a motion picture film analysis by Naval scientists) that had concluded UFOs were under intelligent control and likely extraterrestrial. Extraterrestrial \"believers\" within Project Blue Book included Major Dewey Fournet, in charge of the engineering analysis of UFO motion, who later became a board member on the civilian UFO organization NICAP. Blue Book director Edward J. Ruppelt privately commented on other firm \"pro-UFO\" members in the USAF investigations, including some Pentagon generals, such as Charles P. Cabell, USAF Chief of Air Intelligence, who, angry at the inaction and debunkery of Project Grudge, dissolved it in 1951, established Project Blue Book in its place, and made Ruppelt director. In 1953, Cabell became deputy director of the CIA. Another defector from the official Air Force party line was consultant J. Allen Hynek, who started out as a staunch skeptic. After 20 years of investigation, he changed positions and generally supported the ETH. He became the most publicly known UFO advocate scientist in the 1970s and 1980s. The first CIA Director, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, stated in a signed statement to Congress, also reported in The New York Times (February 28, 1960): \"It is time for the truth to be brought out... Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. However, through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense... I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects.\" In 1962, in his letter of resignation from NICAP, he told director Donald Keyhoe, \"I know the UFOs are not U.S. or Soviet devices. All we can do now is wait for some actions by the UFOs.\" Although the 1968 Condon Report came to a negative conclusion (written by Condon), it is known that many members of the study strongly disagreed with Condon's methods and biases. Most quit the project in disgust, or were fired for insubordination. A few became ETH supporters. Perhaps the best known example is David Saunders, who in his 1968 book UFOs? Yes lambasted Condon for extreme bias, and for ignoring or misrepresenting critical evidence. Saunders wrote: \"It is clear... that the sightings have been going on for too long to explain in terms of straightforward terrestrial intelligence. It's in this sense that ETI (Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) stands as the 'least implausible' explanation of 'real UFOs'.\" In 1999, the private French COMETA report (written primarily by military defense analysts) stated the conclusion regarding UFO phenomena, that a \"single hypothesis sufficiently takes into account the facts and, for the most part, only calls for present-day science. It is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors.\" The report noted issues with formulating the extraterrestrial hypothesis, likening its study to the study of meteorites, but concluded, that although it was far from the best scientific hypothesis, \"strong presumptions exist in its favour\". The report also concludes, that the studies it presents, \"demonstrate the almost certain physical reality of completely unknown flying objects with remarkable flight performances and noiselessness, apparently operated by intelligent [beings] ... Secret craft definitely of earthly origins (drones, stealth aircraft, etc.) can only explain a minority of cases. If we go back far enough in time, we clearly perceive the limits of this explanation.\" Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of the official French UFO investigation SEPRA, wrote a book in 2005, saying, that 14% of the 5800 cases studied by SEPRA were 'utterly inexplicable and extraterrestrial' in origin. However, the CNES own report says 28% of sightings remain unidentified. Yves Sillard, the head of the new official French UFO investigation GEIPAN and former head of French space agency CNES, echoes Velasco's comments and adds, that the United States 'is guilty of covering up this information.' However, this is not the official public posture of SEPRA, CNES, or the French government. (The CNES placed their 5,800 case files on the Internet starting March 2007.) Official White House position[edit] In November 2011, the White House released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, \"The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.\" Also, according to the response, there is \"no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye.\" The response further noted that efforts, like SETI, the Kepler space telescope and the NASA Mars rover, continue looking for signs of life. The response noted \"the odds are pretty high\" that there may be life on other planets but \"the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones—are extremely small, given the distances involved.\" See also[edit] Alan F.

                        "Santorini claimed the investigation was then quashed by military officials from the U.S., who knew them to be extraterrestrial, because there was no defense against the advanced technology and they feared widespread panic should the results become public",

                        "this fixation on the ETH has narrowed and impoverished the debate, precluding an examination of other possible theories for the phenomenon.\" An informal poll done by Sturrock in 1973 of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics members found that about 10% of them believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space.[failed verification][failed verification] In another informal poll conducted in 1977 by astrophysicist Peter A",

                        "However, others within the CIA, such as the Psychological Strategy Board, were more concerned about how an unfriendly power such as the Soviet Union might use UFOs for psychological warfare purposes, exploit the gullibility of the public for the sensational, and clog intelligence channels",

January 7, 2020 Few foods or drinks have been as well studied as coffee. Research has looked at coffee's possible connection to cancer, infertility, heart disease and a host of other problems (more on some of these later). But, did you ever hear that coffee might stunt your growth? Apparently, it's a common belief. Separating Truth from Fiction There is no scientifically valid evidence to suggest that coffee can stunt a person's growth. This idea may have come from the misconception that coffee causes osteoporosis (a condition that may be associated with loss of height). But blaming coffee for height loss due to osteoporosis is faulty reasoning for at least two reasons: Coffee does not cause osteoporosis. Osteoporosis does not routinely make you short. The other problem with the \"coffee stunts your growth\" theory is that most growth occurs well before most people are drinking coffee regularly. By the time we're in our teens, most people have almost reached their full height. For girls, this is usually by age 15 to 17; for boys, it's a bit later. You can't \"undo\" bone growth once it's complete. Decades ago, studies reported that coffee drinkers might have an increased risk of osteoporosis. It was suggested that: Caffeine can increase the body's elimination of calcium. Lack of calcium can contribute to osteoporosis. Naturally, this attracted lots of attention and concern. After all, there are millions of coffee drinkers, so presumably all of them could be at risk. But the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small. And the link between coffee consumption and osteoporosis was never confirmed. In fact, when the studies suggesting a link were analyzed, it turned out that people who drank more coffee also drank less milk and other calcium-containing beverages. So it was probably the dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D among coffee drinkers, not the coffee, that increased the risk of osteoporosis. Causes of Height Loss Osteoporosis with compression fractures can reduce an adult's height. But you can also lose height without osteoporosis. The discs above and below most of the spinal bones (vertebrae) contain water. They lose water with age, so they can degenerate and compress a bit. If enough discs are affected, you can lose a measureable amount of height over time. Curvature of the spine (scoliosis) or bending of the spine forward (kyphosis) can also lead to height loss. The most common causes of scoliosis and kyphosis include osteoporosis (in adults) and developmental abnormalities (in kids). For anyone concerned about the effect of coffee consumption on bone health, getting more calcium and vitamin D through diet (or supplements) could readily address this. And while it's true that people who have osteoporosis of the spine can lose height (and often have curved spines), it's the fractures, not the osteoporosis itself, that lead to height loss. The Risks and Benefits of Coffee Many studies have failed to identify serious medical risks associated with coffee drinking. Coffee can cause insomnia, a jittery feeling and a slight (and temporary) elevation in blood pressure in some people. Excessive coffee consumption (six or more cups per day) has been associated with reduced fertility and miscarriage (although definitive studies are not available). In addition, caffeine withdrawal is a common cause of headaches; higher intake can trigger migraine headaches; and it can worsen heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). But most coffee drinkers have no bothersome side effects. And many studies have \"cleared\" coffee as a cause of serious disease, including cancer and heart disease. In fact, research has linked coffee consumption to several health benefits, including a reduced risk of: Type 2 diabetes Abnormal heart rhythms Stroke Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease Liver disease Certain cancers (especially liver cancer) Gout Caffeine can also briefly enhance athletic performance and promote weight loss. (By the way, many competitive sports ban excessive caffeine intake by athletes.) Some of these potential benefits may not just be related to caffeine. For example, maybe coffee drinkers have healthier lifestyles than non-coffee drinkers. If true, those lifestyle differences, not the coffee, could account for the lower risk of certain diseases. Just as the \"link\" between coffee and osteoporosis turned out to have another explanation, these potential health benefits could turn out to be unrelated to coffee. The Bottom Line Whether or not coffee turns out to have significant health benefits, this popular beverage doesn't stunt your growth. Your height is largely determined by the height of your parents and the quality of your diet and overall health while growing. If you eat a balanced diet and take measures to avoid osteoporosis, you're likely to achieve the maximum height \"allowed\" by your genes. And, sorry: Just as drinking coffee won't make you shorter, avoiding it won't make you any taller.

For the statistical test, see p-value. Cover of Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (2nd ed., 2003) The Psychopathy Checklist or Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, now the Psychopathy Checklist—revised (PCL-R), is a psychological assessment tool that is commonly used to assess the presence and extent of psychopathy in individuals—most often those institutionalized in the criminal justice system—and to differentiate those high in this trait from those with antisocial personality disorder, a related diagnosable disorder. It is a 20-item inventory of perceived personality traits and recorded behaviors, intended to be completed on the basis of a semi-structured interview along with a review of \"collateral information\" such as official records. The psychopath tends to display a constellation or combination of high narcissistic, borderline, and antisocial personality disorder traits, which includes superficial charm, charisma/attractiveness, sexual seductiveness and promiscuity, affective instability, suicidality, lack of empathy, feelings of emptiness, self-harm, and splitting (black and white thinking). In addition, sadistic and paranoid traits are usually also present. The PCL was originally developed in the 1970s by Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare for use in psychology experiments, based partly on Hare's work with male offenders and forensic inmates in Vancouver, and partly on an influential clinical profile by American psychiatrist Hervey M. Cleckley first published in 1941. An individual's score may have important consequences for their future, and because the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable, Hare argues that the test should be considered valid only if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under scientifically controlled and licensed, standardized conditions. Hare receives royalties on licensed use of the test. In psychometric terms, the current version of the checklist has two factors (sets of related scores) that correlate about 0.5 with each other, with Factor One being closer to Cleckley's original personality concept than Factor Two. Hare's checklist does not incorporate the \"positive adjustment features\" that Cleckley did. PCL-R model of psychopathy[edit] The PCL-R is used for indicating a dimensional score, or a categorical diagnosis, of psychopathy for clinical, legal, or research purposes. It is rated by a mental health professional (such as a psychologist or other professional trained in the field of mental health, psychology, or psychiatry), using 20 items. Each of the items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale according to specific criteria through file information and a semi-structured interview. The scores are used to predict risk for criminal re-offense and probability of rehabilitation. The current edition of the PCL-R officially lists three factors (1.a, 1.b, and 2.a), which summarize the 20 assessed areas via factor analysis. The previous edition of the PCL-R listed two factors. Factor 1 is labelled \"selfish, callous and remorseless use of others\". Factor 2 is labelled as \"chronically unstable, antisocial and socially deviant lifestyle\". There is a high risk of recidivism and mostly small likelihood of rehabilitation for those who are labelled as having \"psychopathy\" on the basis of the PCL-R ratings in the manual for the test, although treatment research is ongoing. PCL-R Factors 1a and 1b are correlated with narcissistic personality disorder. They are associated with extraversion and positive affect. Factor 1, the so-called core personality traits of psychopathy, may even be beneficial for the psychopath (in terms of nondeviant social functioning). PCL-R Factors 2a and 2b are particularly strongly correlated to antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder and are associated with reactive anger, criminality, and impulsive violence. The target group for the PCL-R in prisons in some countries is criminals convicted of delict and/or felony. The quality of ratings may depend on how much background information is available and whether the person rated is honest and forthright. Items[edit] Item 1: Glibness/superficial charm Item 2: Grandiose sense of self-worth Item 3: Need for stimulation/proneness to boredom Item 4: Pathological lying Item 5: Conning/manipulative Item 6: Lack of remorse or guilt Item 7: Shallow affect Item 8: Callous/lack of empathy Item 9: Parasitic lifestyle Item 10: Poor behavioral controls Item 11: Promiscuous sexual behavior Item 12: Early behavior problems Item 13: Lack of realistic, long-term goals Item 14: Impulsivity Item 15: Irresponsibility Item 16: Failure to accept responsibility for own actions Item 17: Many short-term marital relationships Item 18: Juvenile delinquency Item 19: Revocation of conditional release Item 20: Criminal versatility Each of the 20 items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale, with a rating of 0 if it does not apply at all, 1 if there is a partial match or mixed information, and 2 if there is a reasonably good match to the offender. This is to be done through a face-to-face interview together with supporting information on lifetime behavior (e.g., from case files). It can take up to three hours to collect and review the information. Out of a maximum score of 40, the cut-off for the label of psychopathy is 30 in the United States and 25 in the United Kingdom. A cut-off score of 25 is also sometimes used for research purposes. High PCL-R scores are positively associated with measures of impulsivity and aggression, Machiavellianism, persistent criminal behavior, and negatively associated with measures of empathy and affiliation. Early factor analysis of the PCL-R indicated it consisted of two factors. Factor 1 captures traits dealing with the interpersonal and affective deficits of psychopathy (e.g., shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, lack of empathy) whereas factor 2 deals with symptoms relating to antisocial behavior (e.g., criminal versatility, impulsiveness, irresponsibility, poor behavior controls, juvenile delinquency). The two factors have been found by those following this theory to display different correlates. Factor 1 has been correlated with narcissistic personality disorder, low anxiety, low empathy, low stress reaction and low suicide risk but high scores on scales of achievement and social potency. In addition, the use of item response theory analysis of female offender PCL-R scores indicates factor 1 items are more important in measuring and generalizing the construct of psychopathy in women than factor 2 items. In contrast, Factor 2 was found to be related to antisocial personality disorder, social deviance, sensation seeking, low socioeconomic status and high risk of suicide. The two factors are nonetheless highly correlated and there are strong indications they do result from a single underlying disorder. Research, however, has failed to replicate the two-factor model in female samples. In 2001 researchers Cooke and Michie at Glasgow Caledonian University suggested, using statistical analysis involving confirmatory factor analysis, that a three-factor structure may provide a better model, with those items from factor 2 strictly relating to antisocial behavior (criminal versatility, juvenile delinquency, revocation of conditional release, early behavioral problems and poor behavioral controls) removed. The remaining items would be divided into three factors: arrogant and deceitful interpersonal style, deficient affective experience, and impulsive and irresponsible behavioral style. Hare and colleagues have criticized the Cooke and Michie three-factor model for statistical and conceptual problems, for example, for resulting in impossible parameter combinations (negative variances). In the 2003 edition of the PCL-R, Hare added a fourth antisocial behavior factor, consisting of those factor 2 items excluded in the previous model. Again, these models are presumed to be hierarchical with a single, unified psychopathy disorder underlying the distinct but correlated factors. In the four-factor model of psychopathy, supported by a range of samples, the factors represent the interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and overt antisocial features of the personality disorder. Use[edit] The PCL-R is widely used to assess individuals in high-security psychiatric units, prisons and other settings. This may be of help in deciding who should be detained or released, or who should undergo what kind of treatment. It is also used in academic psychology for its original purpose as an assistive tool in studies on the pathology of psychopathy. The PCL-R is also used as a risk assessment tool that attempts to predict who will offend or reoffend (recidivism). It is effective in assessing risk of sexual re-offending, which is especially helpful, as clinical judgement of recidivism is a poor predictor. The PCL-R seems to be more useful for violent sexual offenders who are not pedophiles. In controlled research environments the inter-rater reliability of the PCL-R may be satisfactory, but in real-world settings it has been found to have rather poor agreement between different raters, especially on the personality trait scores. Screening and Youth Versions[edit] There are additional inventories directly from the PCL-R, including the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) and Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV). The PCL:SV was developed as a labor-saving assessment for the same forensic settings as the PCL-R and to meet the needs of settings where clients do not necessarily have criminal records (e.g. civil psychiatric patients). It includes 12 items and takes 90 minutes. According to the MacArthur violence risk assessment study in 2014, there is a stronger correlation between the PCL:SV results and later violence than any other of the 134 variables evaluated in that study. The PCL:YV assesses early signs of juvenile psychopathy in children and adolescents. Comparison with psychiatric diagnoses[edit] Among laypersons and professionals, there is confusion about the meanings and differences between psychopathy, sociopathy, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and the ICD-10 diagnosis, dissocial personality disorder. Hare takes the stance that psychopathy as a syndrome should be considered distinct from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV's antisocial personality disorder construct, although the DSM states ASPD has been referred to as or includes the disorder of psychopathy. Although the diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners than the diagnosis of psychopathy, Hare believes the PCL-R is better able to predict future criminality, violence, and recidivism than a diagnosis of ASPD. He suggests there are differences between PCL-R-diagnosed psychopaths and non-psychopaths on \"processing and use of linguistic and emotional information\", while such differences are potentially smaller between those diagnosed with ASPD and without. Although Hare wanted the DSM-IV-TR to list psychopathy as a unique disorder, the DSM editors were unconvinced and felt that there was too much room for subjectivity on the part of clinicians when identifying things like remorse and guilt; therefore, the DSM-IV panel decided to stick to observable behavior, namely socially deviant behaviors. Other PCL-R findings and controversy[edit] Findings[edit] According to Hare, one FBI study produced in 1992 found that 44 percent of offenders who killed a police officer were psychopaths. The study was 'Killed in the Line of Duty: A Study of Selected Felonious Killings of Law Enforcement Officers.' Hare has described psychopaths as 'social predators', 'remorseless predators', or in some cases 'lethal predators', and has stated that 'Psychopathic depredations affect people in all races, cultures, and ethnic groups, and at all levels of income and social status'. A study using the PCL-R to examine the relationship between antisocial behavior and suicide found that suicide history was strongly correlated to PCL-R factor 2 (reflecting antisocial deviance) and was not correlated to PCL-R factor 1 (reflecting affective functioning). Given that ASPD (antisocial personality disorder) and BPD (borderline personality disorder) relate to factor 2, whereas psychopathy relates to both factors, this would confirm Hervey M. Cleckley's assertion that psychopaths are relatively immune to suicide. People with ASPD, on the other hand, have a relatively high suicide rate. People with BPD have an even higher suicide rate, which is near 10%. PCL-R factor 1 is correlated to NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) and rarely ever commit suicide, although they may threaten to do so. Controversy[edit] Because an individual's scores may have important consequences for his or her future, the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable. The test can only be considered valid if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under controlled conditions. There has been controversy over the use of the PCL-R by UK prison and secure psychiatric services, including its role in the government's administrative category of 'Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder' (a separate older administrative category of 'psychopathic disorder' in the Mental Health Act was abolished in 2007). One leading forensic psychologist, while Deputy Chief at the Ministry of Justice, has argued that it has not lived up to claims that it could identify those who would not benefit from current treatments or those most likely to violently reoffend. Several recent studies and very large-scale meta-analysis have cast serious doubt on whether the PCL-R performs as well as other instruments, or better than chance. To the extent that it does perform better, it is unclear whether it is due the PCL-R's inclusion of past offending history, rather than the personality trait scores that make it unique. Criticism[edit] In addition to the aforementioned report by Cooke and Michie that a three-factor structure may provide a better model than the two-factor structure, Hare's concept and checklist have faced other criticisms. In 2010, there was controversy after it emerged that Hare had threatened legal action that stopped publication of a peer-reviewed article on the PCL-R. Hare alleged the article quoted or paraphrased him incorrectly. The article eventually appeared, three years later. It alleged that the checklist is wrongly viewed by many as the basic definition of psychopathy, yet it leaves out key factors, while also making criminality too central to the concept. The authors claimed this leads to problems in over-diagnosis and in the use of the checklist to secure convictions. Hare has since stated that he receives less than $35,000 a year from royalties associated with the checklist and its derivatives. Hare's concept has also been criticised as being only weakly applicable to real-world settings and tending towards tautology. It is also said to be vulnerable to \"labeling effects\", to be over-simplistic, reductionist, to embody fundamental attribution error, and not pay enough attention to context and the dynamic nature of human behavior. It has been pointed out that half the criteria can also be signs of mania, hypomania, or frontal lobe dysfunction (e.g., glibness/superficial charm, grandiosity, poor behavioral controls, promiscuous sexual behavior, and irresponsibility). Some research suggests that ratings made using the PCL system depend on the personality of the person doing the rating, including how empathic they themselves are. One forensic researcher has suggested that future studies need to examine the class background, race, and philosophical beliefs of raters because they may not be aware of enacting biased judgments on people whom they do not readily empathize with. Further, a review which pooled various risk assessment instruments including the PCL, found that peer-reviewed studies for which the developer or translator of the instrument was an author (which in no case was disclosed in the journal article) were twice as likely to report positive predictive findings. Notable evaluations[edit] Lawrence Bittaker was evaluated as 39/40. Canadian serial killer duo Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka were assessed using the checklist. Bernardo was evaluated as 35/40, and Homolka 5/40 (a malignant narcissist). Ted Bundy was evaluated as 39/40. Jeffrey Dahmer was evaluated as 23/40. Brian Dugan was evaluated as 38/40. John Wayne Gacy was evaluated as 27/40. Charles Guiteau was evaluated as 37.5/40. Peter Lundin was evaluated as 39/40. Brian David Mitchell was evaluated as 34/40. Clifford Olson was evaluated as 38/40. Gary Ridgway, known as the Green River Killer, was evaluated at 19/40. Aileen Wuornos was evaluated as 32/40. Dwight York was evaluated as 39/40. Daniel William Marsh was evaluated as 35.8/40.

Nearly all older words were formed in other ways. [Military] Brat : Not an acronym for \"British Regiment Attached Traveller\". This is just a specific instance of the word brat , meaning child or offspring. \"Chav\": see under \"Other\" Coma : Some falsely believe that the word coma originates from \"cessation of motor activity\". Although this describes the condition of coma, this is not the true derivation. The word is actually derived from the Greek kōma , meaning deep sleep . Fuck: see under \"Profanity\" Golf : did not originate as an acronym of \"gentlemen only, ladies forbidden\". The word's true origin is unknown, but it existed in the Middle Scots period. News: The word news has been claimed to be an acronym of the four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south). However, old spellings of the word varied widely (e.g., newesse, newis, nevis, neus, newys, niewes, newis, nues, etc.). Additionally, an identical term exists in French, \"les nouvelles\", which translates as the plural of \"the new\". \"News\" also does not stand for \"notable events, weather, and sports\". The word \"news\" is simply a plural form of new . Pom or pommy is an Australian English , New Zealand English , and South African English term for a person of British descent or origin. The exact origins of the term remain obscure ( see here for further information ). A legend persists that the term arises from the acronym P.O.M.E., for \"prisoner of Mother England\" (or P.O.H.M, \"prisoners of His/Her Majesty\"), although there is no evidence to support this assertion. Posh was not an acronym for wealthy British passengers getting \"port out, starboard home\" cabins on ocean liners to India, in order to get ocean breeze. The actual origins of the word are unknown. [ citation needed ] Rap was not an acronym for \"random acts of poetry\" used as speech-lyrics in contemporary music. The word means \"to utter forcefully\" and appeared as early as the year 1541. Shit: see under \"Profanity\" Swag is not an acronym for \"stuff we all get,\" \"secretly we are gay,\" or anything else. It comes from early-19th-century slang for a thief's booty or loot.

After her debut album, Love Songs (1992), was released at age 12 exclusively in Japan, she went on to record Let's Go Bang (1995), Jennifer Love Hewitt (1996) and BareNaked (2002), the latter of which became her first album to chart in the United States, peaking at number 37 on the Billboard 200 chart.

In addition to music and acting, Hewitt has served as a producer on some of her film and television projects. She has appeared in several magazines' lists of the world's most beautiful women. Early life Hewitt was born in Waco, Texas to Patricia Mae (née Shipp), a speech-language pathologist, and Herbert Daniel Hewitt, a medical technician. She grew up in Nolanville in Central Texas, and has close kinship ties in parts of Arkansas. After their parents divorced, Hewitt and her older brother Todd were raised by their mother. As a toddler, Hewitt was attracted to music, which led to her first encounters with the entertainment industry. At age three, she sang \"The Greatest Love of All\" at a livestock show. The following year, at a restaurant-dance hall, she entertained an audience with her version of \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\". By age five, she had tap dancing and ballet in her portfolio. At nine, she became a member of the Texas Show Team, an L.A. Gear troupe, which also toured the Soviet Union. Acting career 1989–1994: Early acting credits Hewitt moved to Los Angeles, at age ten, with her mother, to pursue a career in both acting and singing, at the suggestion of talent scouts, and after winning the title of \"Texas Our Little Miss Talent Winner\". She attended Lincoln High School where her classmates included Jonathan Neville, who became a talent scout and recommended Hewitt for her role in Party of Five. Hewitt appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys. Her first break came as a child actress on the Disney Channel variety show Kids Incorporated (1989–1991), which earned her, as a member of the cast, three Young Artist Award nominations. In 1992, she appeared in the live action video short Dance! Workout with Barbie (1992), which was released by Buena Vista, and obtained her first feature film role in the independent production Munchie, in which she played Andrea, the love interest of a bullied young boy. A year later, she had her first starring role in Little Miss Millions, as a wealthy nine-year old who runs away from her stepmother to find her real mother, and appeared as a choir member in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Hewitt played Pierce Brosnan's daughter in a pilot for NBC called Running Wilde (1993), which featured Brosnan as a reporter for Auto World magazine, whose stories cover his own wild auto adventures, but the series was not picked up and the pilot never aired. Hewitt later had roles in several short-lived television series, such as Fox's Shaky Ground (1992–1993), ABC's The Byrds of Paradise (1994), and McKenna (1994–95). 1995–1999: Rise to stardom Hewitt rose to teen idol status after landing the role of Sarah Reeves Merrin on the popular Fox show Party of Five (1995–99). Originally cast for a nine-episode arc in season two, reception from producers and audiences was so positive that she became a series regular, continuing to play the character until the show's sixth and final season. Co-creator Amy Lippman once stated: \"She was a crazy professional. You didn't have to ask yourself, ‘I don't know if she'll be able to work up a head of steam here, I don't know if she'll be able to cry.' She wasn't running to her trailer [between takes] to smoke cigarettes or play with a toy poodle. She was reading material and trying to plot her career\". For her performance, Hewitt garnered nominations for a Kids' Choice Award, a Teen Choice Award and a YoungStar Award.[citation needed] Hewitt became a film star with the release of the horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), in which she starred opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze, Jr, portraying Julie James, the final girl. She was cast in the role based on her \"ability to project vulnerability,\" which the producers, director Jim Gillespie, and writer Kevin Williamson unanimously agreed upon. While the film received mixed reviews, an Entertainment Weekly columnist praised Hewitt's performance, noting that she knows how to \"scream with soul\". Budgeted at US$17 million, the movie made US$125 million globally. For her role, she received a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Feature Film — Leading Young Actress and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Female Newcomer. She appeared in the sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), which, though not as successful as the first film, took in more money on its opening weekend. Hewitt starred as Amanda Beckett, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, in the teen comedy Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Critic James Berardinelli asserted that Hewitt was \"so likable that it's hard not to have at least a minor rooting interest\" in her character, and with a US$25.6 million gross at the North American domestic box office, the film emerged as a moderate commercial success. Telling You, another 1998 teen comedy, featured Hewitt as the annoyingly sweet ex-girlfriend of a college student working in a pizza joint. In 1999, she played a record company executive in the independent comedy The Suburbans and starred in and produced Time of Your Life, a Party of Five spin-off following her character as she moved to New York City to learn more about her biological parents. Despite Hewitt's popularity at the time, the show received a lackluster viewership and was cancelled after only half the season had aired. 2000–2004: Steady film work Hewitt in 2002 In The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), a biographical drama television film based on the life of actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn, Hewitt starred as the title role and served as an executive producer. She had been recommended for the role by director Steven Robman, who had previously directed her in Party of Five. The production aired as a three-hour film on ABC on March 27, 2000, and drew mixed reviews. Entertainment Weekly wrote that Hewitt had \"guts\" to take on the role and called her \"excellent at conveying Hepburn's studied modesty\", while The Baltimore Sun review stated: \"What's impossibly wrong with this film is that Hewitt has no physical grace while Hepburn was the very embodiment of it\". Hewitt starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in the romantic comedy Heartbreakers (2001), playing a mother-daughter team setting up an elaborate con to swindle wealthy men out of their money. Roger Ebert noted that Hewitt \"spends the entire film with her treasures on display, maybe as product placement for the Wonderbra\", while BBC.com asserted: \"Hewitt though, lacks the necessary duplicity for her character and is too patently agreeable to bitch convincingly, ultimately reducing her to eye-candy among the professionals. Still, she has the right cleavage for the role, and there's sure to be legions of men thankful for that alone\". The film made a moderate US$57.7 million globally. Hewitt starred as a genius scientist with aspirations of field work, alongside Jackie Chan, in the action comedy The Tuxedo (2002). Robert Koehler of Variety noted that Hewitt \"has displayed a Chan-like sweetness herself in past roles\" and was disappointed that her character is \"a haggling, high-strung shrew who's instantly repellent\" rather than an amusing sidekick as Chan has had in other Hollywood films. The film made US$104.4 million worldwide. In 2002, she also lent her voice for two direct-to-DVD animated films —The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. In 2004, Hewitt starred as a musician in the romantic fantasy drama If Only, the love interest of Ebenezer Scrooge in the television film A Christmas Carol, and Dr. Liz Wilson in the live-action comedy Garfield. With a worldwide gross of US$200 million, Garfield became Hewitt's highest-grossing film to date. 2005–2010: Return to television Hewitt in 2008 Hewitt portrayed Melinda Gordon, a woman with the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, on the CBS television series Ghost Whisperer, which ran on CBS for five seasons and 107 episodes, from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010. She also served as a producer and directed three episodes, including the 100th episode. In his review for the first season, David Bianculli, of New York Daily News, wrote: \"If [television] really wants a success built around this actress, someone in Hollywood should pay attention to her chameleonic and comedic role in Heartbreakers, and give her a role that plays to those strengths, instead of something this translucent\". Nevertheless, the series emerged as a ratings success and earned Hewitt two Saturn Awards for Best Television Actress. In 2005, she played a happily married English woman in the romantic comedy The Truth About Love, and a 28-year-old advertising executive more concerned with being a well-known socialite than being a good person in the television film Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber. Hewitt reprised her role as Dr. Liz Wilson for Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (2006), which, though it did not perform as well as its predecessor, achieved a strong box office gross. Her next film release was the comedy Shortcut to Happiness, in which she starred as The Devil, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. Filmed in NYC in early 2001, the film became an asset in a federal bank fraud trial when investor Jed Barron was convicted of bank fraud while the film was in production. The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group and was finally released in 2007. In 2008, she made a cameo appearance in the successful action comedy Tropic Thunder, and reunited with Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated production Delgo which, when released, was a massive box office bomb, taking in only US$694,782 in North America. In 2010, Hewitt portrayed a good-hearted barista in the independent drama Café, and a struggling prostitute in the Lifetime film The Client List. While a reviewer felt that Hewitt did \"a surprisingly credible job of acting seen-it-all exasperated and emotionally mature without once going giggly-girly\" in Café, Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker felt that the actress was able to sell The Client List to the audiences due to her \"talent for communicating sincerity and charm\". She received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for the latter. 2011–present: Continued television roles Hewitt starred as a journalist, opposite Betty White, in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film The Lost Valentine (2011). While reviewers unanimously praised White's performance, Variety wrote: \"The same can hardly be said of Hewitt, who —in her current TV movie phase— was put to better use as a mom turned hooker in Lifetime's The Client List. With 14.53 million viewers, the film won its time period and represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years. Hewitt in 2018 In 2012, Hewitt starred as the love interest of a gentile pretending to be Jewish, alongside Ivan Sergei and Joel David Moore in the independent comedy Jewtopia, and played an erotic massagist in the television series The Client List. Based on the 2010 television film of the same name, the series ran for two seasons and featured Hewitt as a different character in a premise that was slightly different from the film. Between 2014 and 2015, Hewitt played the regular role of Kate Callahan, an undercover agent who joins the BAU, in the tenth season of Criminal Minds. She left the series at the end of the season due to her second pregnancy, and decided to take a career hiatus for the next three years. In an interview with Elle magazine, Hewitt remarked: “I was looking in the mirror, talking with myself, going, ‘Hey, we started something, remember? We were gonna take a step back. So let's do that.'\" Beginning in 2018, Hewitt has played Maddie Buckley, an ER nurse working as a 9-1-1 operator after leaving an abusive relationship, on the Fox police procedural 9-1-1. Describing her character, she stated: \"Maddie has a toughness to her. But she's also empathetic and sensitive. People will see her composed on the phone, but fully dealing with the pain and anguish of the callers [once she hangs up]\". Other endeavors Music Hewitt was one of the backing vocalists on Martika's number-one single, \"Toy Soldiers\" (1989). At age 12, Meldac funded the recording of Hewitt's debut studio album, Love Songs (1992). The album was released exclusively in Japan, where Hewitt became a pop star. Her explanation for her success in Japan is that the Japanese \"love perky music. The poppier the music, the better.\" She was subsequently signed to Atlantic Records, who released her next two albums —Let's Go Bang (1995) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (1996). The albums, along with their singles, failed to chart and Atlantic dropped Hewitt, who did not return to the music scene for three years. Hewitt recorded the single \"How Do I Deal\" (1999) for the I Still Know What You Did Last Summer soundtrack, which became her first charting single, climbing to No. 59 on the Hot 100 and No. 36 on the Top 40 Mainstream. It reached No. 8 in Australia. She also recorded a cover of the Gloria Gaynor song \"I Will Survive\", which is featured briefly in the film. Hewitt appeared in the LFO video for \"Girl on TV\" (1999), a song which band member Rich Cronin band wrote for her while the two were dating. She also appeared in the music video for the Enrique Iglesias song, \"Hero\" (2001), as the singer's love interest. In 2002, Hewitt signed to Jive Records and recorded her fourth studio album, BareNaked, with singer, songwriter, and producer Meredith Brooks. The first single, \"BareNaked\" (2002), became her biggest radio hit to date when it peaked at No. 24 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, No. 31 on the Adult Top 40 and No. 25 on the Top 40 Mainstream. It climbed to No. 6 in Australia, remaining there for two weeks, and reached No. 33 in the Netherlands. The song later featured in two episodes of Ghost Whisperer: \"The Vanishing\" (Season 1, episode 20) and \"The Collector\" (Season 2, episode 20). The moderate success of the single propelled the album to peak at No. 37 on the Billboard 200 and No. 31 in Australia. However, it only remained on the chart for three weeks. The second single, \"Can I Go Now\" (2003), failed to chart in the US, while managing to peak at No. 8 in the Netherlands and No. 12 in Australia. Since 2004, Hewitt has remained mostly inactive in the music industry, but she released the compilation albums Cool with You: The Platinum Collection (2006) in Asia and Hey Everybody (2007) in Brazil. In 2013, she recorded a cover of \"I'm a Woman\" to promote the second season of The Client List and shot a music video for the song, which reached the top ten in the iTunes Music Video chart. Writing In November 2009, Hewitt made a foray into comic books, when writer Scott Lobdell scripted the five-issue anthology, Jennifer Love Hewitt's Music Box (2009–2010), based on Hewitt's ideas. The series was published by IDW Publishing and was collected in a trade paperback. She wrote a book titled The Day I Shot Cupid (2010), in which she speaks of her experiences with love and dating. While promoting the book during a January 2010, interview on Lopez Tonight, Hewitt said that there is a chapter in it about \"vajazzling\" (decorating a woman's pubis with crystals or rhinestones). This became a big internet hit with the video going viral, widespread news coverage and the term \"vajazzling\" becoming one of the most searched terms on Google the next day. She has since been credited for the popularization of this trend. Helium.com gave the book a positive review, stating: \"Jennifer Love Hewitt's book provides some good guidelines for those that need to work on clarifying their relationship desires before trying to establish their relationships\". It was commercially successful upon its release, becoming a New York Times bestseller within a week. Public image Hewitt in 2011 Regarded as a sex symbol, Hewitt's public \"narrative\" throughout her career has been that of \"the sexy girl next door [or] the MVP of Maxim\". As noted by Elle magazine, it was \"bequeathed\" to her around the time she turned 18 and starred in I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and Can't Hardly Wait (1998), roles which, along with Party of Five, \"cemented her status as an icon to a whole generation. Every girl wanted to be her, and every boy had a poster of her on his wall\". On her public image, she said: \"I think when you start [in Hollywood] younger, the narrative takes off without you. And you kind of go, ‘Oh, okay [...] so I'm that person? Great!’ Before I ever knew in my life what 'sexy' was, I was on the sexy list”. Hewitt has appeared in several magazines' lists of the world's most beautiful women. In 2002, she was voted 7th in FHM's Sexiest Girls poll, 14th in Rush's Sexiest Women list, and 11th in Stuff's \"102 Sexiest Women in the World\". She has ranked 32nd, 20th, 35th, 20th, 6th, and 35th in Maxim magazine's Hot 100 Women in 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively. Hewitt was identified as the \"number one reader choice\" on the November 1999 and May 2009 covers of Maxim. TV Guide named her the sexiest woman on television in 2008. Hewitt graced the February 1997 cover of Seventeen, and in subsequent years, the list went on to include Rolling Stone, Cosmopolitan, GQ, CosmoGirl, Shape, Health, Maxim, FHM, Vanidades and Jane. Hewitt has appeared in numerous print advertisements and commercials for brands such as Victoria Golf, Mrs. Smith, Colonial's Iron Kids Bread, Levi's, Barbie, LA Gear, Chex, Proactiv, Hanes, Neutrogena, Nokia, Jansport and America's Dairy Producers. In 2000, Hewitt was named the \"most popular actress on television\", as her Q Score — the industry's measure of celebrities' likability — was 37, and in 2008, she ranked as 96th on the annual Celebrity 100 list by Forbes magazine, which ranks the most powerful and best-paid celebrities in Hollywood. Personal life Relationships and family Between the 1990s and the 2000s, Hewitt dated several high-profile figures, including Joey Lawrence, Will Friedle, Carson Daly, Rich Cronin, Patrick Wilson, John Mayer and Jamie Kennedy. In 2005, Hewitt began dating Scottish actor Ross McCall after he made an appearance on Ghost Whisperer. They became engaged in November 2007, while vacationing in Hawaii. People magazine reported that Hewitt called off their engagement in late 2008. In March 2012, Hewitt started dating her co-star on The Client List, Brian Hallisay. In June 2013, Hewitt announced that she was engaged and expecting her first child with Hallisay. On November 20, 2013, Hewitt and Hallisay married. Their daughter was born a few days later on November 26. In June 2015, the couple had a boy. In August 2021, Hewitt and Hallisay welcomed their third child. Stalking incident In 2002, at the Grammy Awards, Diana Napolis, a conspiracy theorist and former social worker, \"verbally confront[ed]\" Hewitt and attempted to pose as a friend of hers in order to enter the premiere of The Tuxedo; she was then arrested for stalking and uttering death threats against Hewitt and Steven Spielberg. Napolis was charged with six felonies related to the incidents. After almost a year of involuntary commitment and prison, Napolis pleaded guilty and was released on probation with a condition that she was barred from any contact with both Spielberg and Hewitt.

He was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature for his \"wide cultural perspective and... poetic overtones fashioning the drama of existence\", the first sub-Saharan African to be honoured in that category.[a] Soyinka was born into a Yoruba family in Abeokuta, Nigeria. In 1954, he attended Government College in Ibadan, and subsequently University College Ibadan and the University of Leeds in England. After studying in Nigeria and the UK, he worked with the Royal Court Theatre in London. He went on to write plays that were produced in both countries, in theatres and on radio. He took an active role in Nigeria's political history and its campaign for independence from British colonial rule. In 1965, he seized the Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service studio and broadcast a demand for the cancellation of the Western Nigeria Regional Elections. In 1967, during the Nigerian Civil War, he was arrested by the federal government of General Yakubu Gowon and put in solitary confinement for two years, for volunteering to be a non-government mediating actor. Soyinka has been a strong critic of successive Nigerian (and African at large) governments, especially the country's many military dictators, as well as other political tyrannies, including the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. Much of Soyinka's writing is concerned with \"the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it\". During the regime of General Sani Abacha (1993–98), Soyinka escaped from Nigeria on a motorcycle via the Benin border. Abacha later proclaimed a death sentence against him \"in absentia\". With civilian rule restored to Nigeria in 1999, Soyinka returned there. From 1975 to 1999, Soyinka had been Professor of Comparative literature (1975–1999) at Obafemi Awolowo University, then called the University of Ifẹ̀, and in 1999, he was made professor emeritus. While in the United States, he taught at Cornell University as Goldwin Smith professor for African Studies and Theatre Arts from 1988 to 1991 and then at Emory University, where in 1996 he was appointed Robert W. Woodruff Professor of the Arts. He has been a Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and has served as scholar-in-residence at New York University's Institute of African American Affairs and at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. He has also taught at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard and Yale, and was a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at Duke University in 2008. In December 2017, Soyinka received the Europe Theatre Prize in the \"Special Prize\" category, awarded to someone who has \"contributed to the realization of cultural events that promote understanding and the exchange of knowledge between peoples\". Life and work[edit] A descendant of the rulers of Isara, Soyinka was born the second of his parents' seven children, in the city of Abẹokuta, Ogun State, in Nigeria, at that time a British dominion. His siblings were Atinuke \"Tinu\" Aina Soyinka, Femi Soyinka, Yeside Soyinka, Omofolabo \"Folabo\" Ajayi-Soyinka and Kayode Soyinka. His younger sister Folashade Soyinka died on her first birthday. His father, Samuel Ayodele Soyinka (whom he called S.A. or \"Essay\"), was an Anglican minister and the headmaster of St. Peters School in Abẹokuta. Having solid family connections, the elder Soyinka was a cousin of the Odemo, or King, of Isara-Remo Samuel Akinsanya, a founding father of Nigeria. Soyinka's mother, Grace Eniola Soyinka (née Jenkins-Harrison) (whom he dubbed the \"Wild Christian\"), owned a shop in the nearby market. She was a political activist within the women's movement in the local community. She was also Anglican. As much of the community followed indigenous Yorùbá religious tradition, Soyinka grew up in a religious atmosphere of syncretism, with influences from both cultures. He was raised in a religious family, attending church services and singing in the choir from an early age; however, Soyinka himself became an atheist later in life. His father's position enabled him to get electricity and radio at home. He writes extensively about his childhood in his memoir Aké: The Years of Childhood (1981). Soyinka, at Festivaletteratura in Mantua, 7 September 2019, Teatro Bibiena. His mother was one of the most prominent members of the influential Ransome-Kuti family: she was the granddaughter of Rev. Canon J. J. Ransome-Kuti as the only daughter of his first daughter Anne Lape Iyabode Ransome-Kuti, and was therefore a niece to Olusegun Azariah Ransome-Kuti, Oludotun Ransome-Kuti and niece in-law to Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. Among Soyinka's first cousins once removed were the musician Fela Kuti, the human rights activist Beko Ransome-Kuti, politician Olikoye Ransome-Kuti and activist Yemisi Ransome-Kuti. His second cousins include musicians Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti, and dancer Yeni Kuti. His younger brother Femi Soyinka became a medical doctor and a university professor. In 1940, after attending St. Peter's Primary School in Abeokuta, Soyinka went to Abeokuta Grammar School, where he won several prizes for literary composition. In 1946 he was accepted by Government College in Ibadan, at that time one of Nigeria's elite secondary schools. After finishing his course at Government College in 1952, he began studies at University College Ibadan (1952–54), affiliated with the University of London. He studied English literature, Greek, and Western history. Among his lecturers was Molly Mahood, a British literary scholar. In the year 1953–54, his second and last at University College, Soyinka began work on Keffi's Birthday Treat, a short radio play for Nigerian Broadcasting Service that was broadcast in July 1954. While at university, Soyinka and six others founded the Pyrates Confraternity, an anti-corruption and justice-seeking student organisation, the first confraternity in Nigeria. Later in 1954, Soyinka relocated to England, where he continued his studies in English literature, under the supervision of his mentor Wilson Knight at the University of Leeds (1954–57). He met numerous young, gifted British writers. Before defending his B.A. degree, Soyinka began publishing and working as editor for a satirical magazine called The Eagle; he wrote a column on academic life, in which he often criticised his university peers. Early career[edit] After graduating with an upper second-class degree, Soyinka remained in Leeds and began working on an MA. He intended to write new works combining European theatrical traditions with those of his Yorùbá cultural heritage. His first major play, The Swamp Dwellers (1958), was followed a year later by The Lion and the Jewel, a comedy that attracted interest from several members of London's Royal Court Theatre. Encouraged, Soyinka moved to London, where he worked as a play reader for the Royal Court Theatre. During the same period, both of his plays were performed in Ibadan. They dealt with the uneasy relationship between progress and tradition in Nigeria. In 1957, his play The Invention was the first of his works to be produced at the Royal Court Theatre. At that time his only published works were poems such as \"The Immigrant\" and \"My Next Door Neighbour\", which were published in the Nigerian magazine Black Orpheus. This was founded in 1957 by the German scholar Ulli Beier, who had been teaching at the University of Ibadan since 1950. Soyinka received a Rockefeller Research Fellowship from University College in Ibadan, his alma mater, for research on African theatre, and he returned to Nigeria. After its fifth issue (November 1959), Soyinka replaced Jahnheinz Jahn to become coeditor for the literary periodical Black Orpheus (its name derived from a 1948 essay by Jean-Paul Sartre, \"Orphée Noir\", published as a preface to Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache, edited by Léopold Senghor). He produced his new satire, The Trials of Brother Jero in the dining-hall at Mellanby Hall of University College Ibadan, in April 1960. That year, his work A Dance of The Forest, a biting criticism of Nigeria's political elites, won a contest that year as the official play for Nigerian Independence Day. On 1 October 1960, it premiered in Lagos as Nigeria celebrated its sovereignty. The play satirizes the fledgling nation by showing that the present is no more a golden age than was the past. Also in 1960, Soyinka established the \"Nineteen-Sixty Masks\", an amateur acting ensemble to which he devoted considerable time over the next few years. Soyinka wrote the first full-length play produced on Nigerian television. Entitled My Father's Burden and directed by Segun Olusola, the play was featured on the Western Nigeria Television (WNTV) on 6 August 1960. Soyinka published works satirising the \"Emergency\" in the Western Region of Nigeria, as his Yorùbá homeland was increasingly occupied and controlled by the federal government. The political tensions arising from recent post-colonial independence eventually led to a military coup and civil war (1967–70). With the Rockefeller grant, Soyinka bought a Land Rover, and he began travelling throughout the country as a researcher with the Department of English Language of the University College in Ibadan. In an essay of the time, he criticised Leopold Senghor's Négritude movement as a nostalgic and indiscriminate glorification of the black African past that ignores the potential benefits of modernisation. He is often quoted as having said, \"A tiger doesn't proclaim his tigritude, he pounces.\" But in fact, Soyinka wrote in a 1960 essay for the Horn: \"the duiker will not paint 'duiker' on his beautiful back to proclaim his duikeritude; you'll know him by his elegant leap.\" In Death and the King's Horsemen he states: \"The elephant trails no tethering-rope; that king is not yet crowned who will peg an elephant.\" In December 1962, Soyinka's essay \"Towards a True Theater\" was published in Transition Magazine. He began teaching with the Department of English Language at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ifẹ. He discussed current affairs with \"négrophiles\", and on several occasions openly condemned government censorship. At the end of 1963, his first feature-length movie, Culture in Transition, was released. In 1965, his book The Interpreters, \"a complex but also vividly documentary novel\", was published in London by André Deutsch. That December, together with scientists and men of theatre, Soyinka founded the Drama Association of Nigeria. In 1964 he also resigned his university post, as a protest against imposed pro-government behaviour by the authorities. A few months later, in 1965, he was arrested for the first time, charged with holding up a radio station at gunpoint (as described in his 2006 memoir You Must Set Forth at Dawn) and replacing the tape of a recorded speech by the premier of Western Nigeria with a different tape containing accusations of election malpractice. Soyinka was released after a few months of confinement, as a result of protests by the international community of writers. This same year he wrote two more dramatic pieces: Before the Blackout and the comedy Kongi's Harvest. He also wrote The Detainee, a radio play for the BBC in London. His play The Road premiered in London at the Commonwealth Arts Festival, opening on 14 September 1965, at the Theatre Royal. At the end of the year, he was promoted to headmaster and senior lecturer in the Department of English Language at University of Lagos. Soyinka's political speeches at that time criticised the cult of personality and government corruption in African dictatorships. In April 1966, his play Kongi's Harvest was produced in revival at the World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal. The Road was awarded the Grand Prix. In June 1965, his play The Trials of Brother Jero was produced at the Hampstead Theatre Club in London, and in December 1966 The Lion and the Jewel was staged at the Royal Court Theatre. Civil war and imprisonment[edit] After becoming Chair of Drama at the University of Ibadan, Soyinka became more politically active. Following the military coup of January 1966, he secretly and unofficially met with the military governor Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu in the Southeastern town of Enugu (August 1967), to try to avert the Nigerian civil war. As a result, he had to go into hiding. He was imprisoned for 22 months as civil war ensued between the Federal government of Nigeria and the Biafrans. Though refused materials such as books, pens, and paper, he still wrote a significant body of poems and notes criticising the Nigerian government while in prison. Despite his imprisonment, his play The Lion and The Jewel was produced in Accra, Ghana, in September 1967. In November that year, The Trials of Brother Jero and The Strong Breed were produced in the Greenwich Mews Theatre in New York City. Soyinka also published a collection of his poetry, Idanre and Other Poems, which was inspired by his visit to the sanctuary of the Yorùbá deity Ogun, whom he regards as his \"companion\" deity, kindred spirit, and protector. In 1968, the Negro Ensemble Company in New York produced Kongi's Harvest. While still imprisoned, Soyinka translated from Yoruba a fantastical novel by his compatriot D. O. Fagunwa, entitled The Forest of a Thousand Demons: A Hunter's Saga. Release and literary production[edit] In October 1969, when the civil war came to an end, amnesty was proclaimed, and Soyinka and other political prisoners were freed. For the first few months after his release, Soyinka stayed at a friend's farm in southern France, where he sought solitude. He wrote The Bacchae of Euripides (1969), a reworking of the Pentheus myth. He soon published in London a book of poetry, Poems from Prison. At the end of the year, he returned to his office as Chair of Drama at Ibadan. In 1970, he produced the play Kongi's Harvest, while simultaneously adapting it as a film of the same title. In June 1970, he finished another play, called Madmen and Specialists. Together with the group of 15 actors of Ibadan University Theatre Art Company, he went on a trip to the United States, to the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut, where his latest play premiered. It gave them all experience with theatrical production in another English-speaking country. In 1971, his poetry collection A Shuttle in the Crypt was published. Madmen and Specialists was produced in Ibadan that year. Soyinka travelled to Paris to take the lead role as Patrice Lumumba, the murdered first Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, in the production of Murderous Angels, Conor Cruise O'Brien's play about the Congo Crisis. In April 1971, concerned about the political situation in Nigeria, Soyinka resigned from his duties at the University in Ibadan, and began years of voluntary exile. In July in Paris, excerpts from his well-known play The Dance of The Forests were performed. In 1972, his novel Season of Anomy and his Collected Plays were both published by Oxford University Press. His powerful autobiographical work The Man Died, a collection of notes from prison, was also published that year. He was awarded an Honoris Causa doctorate by the University of Leeds in 1973. In the same year the National Theatre, London, commissioned and premiered the play The Bacchae of Euripides, and his plays Camwood on the Leaves and Jero's Metamorphosis were also first published. From 1973 to 1975, Soyinka spent time on scientific studies.[clarification needed] He spent a year as a visiting fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge University [clarification needed] 1973–74 and wrote Death and the King's Horseman, which had its first reading at Churchill College (which Dapo Ladimeji and Skip Gates attended), and gave a series of lectures at a number of European universities. In 1974, his Collected Plays, Volume II was issued by Oxford University Press. In 1975, Soyinka was promoted to the position of editor for Transition Magazine, which was based in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, where he moved for some time. He used his columns in the magazine to criticise the \"negrophiles\" (for instance, his article \"Neo-Tarzanism: The Poetics of Pseudo-Transition\") and military regimes. He protested against the military junta of Idi Amin in Uganda. After the political turnover in Nigeria and the subversion of Gowon's military regime in 1975, Soyinka returned to his homeland and resumed his position as Chair of Comparative Literature at the University of Ife. In 1976, he published his poetry collection Ogun Abibiman, as well as a collection of essays entitled Myth, Literature and the African World. In these, Soyinka explores the genesis of mysticism in African theatre and, using examples from both European and African literature, compares and contrasts the cultures. He delivered a series of guest lectures at the Institute of African Studies at the University of Ghana in Legon. In October, the French version of The Dance of The Forests was performed in Dakar, while in Ife, his play Death and The King's Horseman premièred. In 1977, Opera Wọnyọsi, his adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's The Threepenny Opera, was staged in Ibadan. In 1979 he both directed and acted in Jon Blair and Norman Fenton's drama The Biko Inquest, a work based on the life of Steve Biko, a South African student and human rights activist who was beaten to death by apartheid police forces. In 1981 Soyinka published his autobiographical work Aké: The Years of Childhood, which won a 1983 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. Soyinka founded another theatrical group called the Guerrilla Unit. Its goal was to work with local communities in analysing their problems and to express some of their grievances in dramatic sketches. In 1983 his play Requiem for a Futurologist had its first performance at the University of Ife. In July, one of his musical projects, the Unlimited Liability Company, issued a long-playing record entitled I Love My Country, on which several prominent Nigerian musicians played songs composed by Soyinka. In 1984, he directed the film Blues for a Prodigal, which was screened at the University of Ife. His A Play of Giants was produced the same year. During the years 1975–84, Soyinka was more politically active. At the University of Ife, his administrative duties included the security of public roads. He criticized the corruption in the government of the democratically elected President Shehu Shagari. When he was replaced by the army general Muhammadu Buhari, Soyinka was often at odds with the military. In 1984, a Nigerian court banned his 1972 book The Man Died: Prison Notes. In 1985, his play Requiem for a Futurologist was published in London by Rex Collings. Since 1986[edit] Soyinka in 2015. Soyinka was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986, becoming the first African laureate. He was described as one \"who in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence\". Reed Way Dasenbrock writes that the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Soyinka is \"likely to prove quite controversial and thoroughly deserved\". He also notes that \"it is the first Nobel Prize awarded to an African writer or to any writer from the 'new literatures' in English that have emerged in the former colonies of the British Empire.\" His Nobel acceptance speech, \"This Past Must Address Its Present\", was devoted to South African freedom-fighter Nelson Mandela. Soyinka's speech was an outspoken criticism of apartheid and the politics of racial segregation imposed on the majority by the National South African government. In 1986, he received the Agip Prize for Literature. In 1988, his collection of poems Mandela's Earth, and Other Poems was published, while in Nigeria another collection of essays, entitled Art, Dialogue and Outrage: Essays on Literature and Culture, appeared. In the same year, Soyinka accepted the position of Professor of African Studies and Theatre at Cornell University. In 1989, a third novel, inspired by his father's intellectual circle, Ìsarà: A Voyage Around Essay, appeared. In July 1991 the BBC African Service transmitted his radio play A Scourge of Hyacinths, and the next year (1992) in Siena (Italy), his play From Zia with Love had its premiere. Both works are very bitter political parodies, based on events that took place in Nigeria in the 1980s. In 1993 Soyinka was awarded an honorary doctorate from Harvard University. The next year another part of his autobiography appeared: Ibadan: The Penkelemes Years (A Memoir: 1946–1965). The following year his play The Beatification of Area Boy was published. In October 1994, he was appointed UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Promotion of African culture, human rights, freedom of expression, media and communication. In November 1994, Soyinka fled from Nigeria on a 12-hour motorcycle via the border with Benin, and then went to the United States. In 1996, his book The Open Sore of a Continent: A Personal Narrative of the Nigerian Crisis was first published. In 1997, he was charged with treason by the government of General Sani Abacha. The International Parliament of Writers (IPW) was established in 1993 to provide support for writers victimized by persecution. Soyinka became the organization's second president from 1997 to 2000. In 1999 a new volume of poems by Soyinka, entitled Outsiders, was released. That same year, a BBC-commissioned play called Document of Identity aired on BBC Radio 3, telling the lightly-fictionalized story of the problems his daughter's family encountered during a stopover in Britain when they fled Nigeria for the US in 1996; her son, Oseoba Airewele was born in Luton and became a stateless person. Soyinka's play King Baabu premièred in Lagos in 2001, a political satire on the theme of African dictatorship. In 2002, a collection of his poems entitled Samarkand and Other Markets I Have Known was published by Methuen. In April 2006, his memoir You Must Set Forth at Dawn was published by Random House. In 2006 he cancelled his keynote speech for the annual S.E.A. Write Awards Ceremony in Bangkok to protest the Thai military's successful coup against the government. In April 2007, Soyinka called for the cancellation of the Nigerian presidential elections held two weeks earlier, beset by widespread fraud and violence. In the wake of the attempting bombing on a Northwest Airlines flight to the United States by a Nigerian student who had become radicalised in Britain, Soyinka questioned the British government's social logic in allowing every religion to openly proselytise their faith, asserting that it was being abused by religious fundamentalists, thereby turning England into, in his view, a cesspit for the breeding of extremism. He supported the freedom of worship but warned against the consequence of the illogic of allowing religions to preach apocalyptic violence. In August 2014, Soyinka delivered a recording of his speech \"From Chibok with Love\" to the World Humanist Congress in Oxford, hosted by the International Humanist and Ethical Union and the British Humanist Association. The Congress theme was Freedom of thought and expression: Forging a 21st Century Enlightenment. He was awarded the 2014 International Humanist Award. He served as scholar-in-residence at NYU's Institute of African American Affairs. Soyinka opposes allowing Fulani herdsmen the ability to graze their cattle on open land in southern, Christian-dominated Nigeria and believes these herdsmen should be declared terrorists to enable the restriction of their movements. In December 2020, Soyinka described 2020 as the most challenging year in the nation's history, saying: \"With the turbulence that characterised year 2020, and as activities wind down, the mood has been repugnant and very negative. I don't want to sound pessimistic but this is one of the most pessimistic years I have known in this nation and it wasn't just because of COVID-19. Natural disasters had happened elsewhere, but how have you managed to take such in their strides?\" September 2021 saw the publication of Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth, Soyinka's first novel in almost 50 years, described in the Financial Times as \"a brutally satirical look at power and corruption in Nigeria, told in the form of a whodunnit involving three university friends.\" Reviewing the book in The Guardian, Ben Okri said: \"It is Soyinka's greatest novel, his revenge against the insanities of the nation's ruling class and one of the most shocking chronicles of an African nation in the 21st century. It ought to be widely read.\" The film adaptation by Biyi Bandele of Soyinka's 1975 stage play Death and the King's Horseman, co-produced by Netflix and Ebonylife TV, titled Elesin Oba, The King's Horseman, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 2022. It is Soyinka's first work to be made into a feature film, and the first Yoruba-language film to premiere at TIFF. Personal life[edit] Soyinka has been married three times and divorced twice. He has eight children from his three marriages and two other daughters. His first marriage was in 1958 to the late British writer Barbara Dixon, whom he met at the University of Leeds in the 1950s. Barbara was the mother of his first son, Olaokun, and his daughter Morenike. His second marriage was in 1963 to Nigerian librarian Olaide Idowu, with whom he had three daughters – Moremi, Iyetade (1965–2013), Peyibomi – and a second son, Ilemakin. Soyinka's youngest daughter is Amani. Soyinka married Folake Doherty in 1989 and the couple have three sons: Tunlewa, Bojode and Eniara. In 2014, Soyinka revealed his battle with prostate cancer. Soyinka has commented on his close friendships with Toni Morrison and Henry Louis Gates Jr., saying: \"Friendship, to me, is what saves one's sanity.\" Religion[edit] On Sunday, 20 November 2022; during a public presentation of his two-volume collection of essays, Soyinka said in relation to religion: \"Do I really need one (religion)? I have never felt I needed one. I am a mythologist. ... No, I don't worship any deity. But I consider deities as creatively real and therefore my companions in my journey in both the real world and the imaginative world.\" Around July 2023, Soyinka came under severe criticism, after writing an open letter to the Emir of Ilorin, Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, over the cancellation of the Isese festival proposed by an Osun priestess, Omolara Olatunji, popularly known as Yeye Ajesikemi. Legacy and honours[edit] The Wole Soyinka Annual Lecture Series was founded in 1994 and \"is dedicated to honouring one of Nigeria and Africa's most outstanding and enduring literary icons: Professor Wole Soyinka\". It is organised by the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity), which organisation Soyinka with six other students founded in 1952 at the then University College Ibadan. In 2011, the African Heritage Research Library and Cultural Centre built a writers' enclave in his honour. It is located in Adeyipo Village, Lagelu Local Government Area, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The enclave includes a Writer-in-Residence Programme that enables writers to stay for a period of two, three or six months, engaging in serious creative writing. In 2013, he visited the Benin Moat as the representative of UNESCO in recognition of the Naija seven Wonders project. He is currently the consultant for the Lagos Black Heritage Festival, with the Lagos State deeming him as the only person who could bring out the aims and objectives of the Festival to the people. He was appointed a patron of Humanists UK in 2020. In 2014, the collection Crucible of the Ages: Essays in Honour of Wole Soyinka at 80, edited by Ivor Agyeman-Duah and Ogochwuku Promise, was published by Bookcraft in Nigeria and Ayebia Clarke Publishing in the UK, with tributes and contributions from Nadine Gordimer, Toni Morrison, Ama Ata Aidoo, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Henry Louis Gates, Jr, Margaret Busby, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Ali Mazrui, Sefi Atta, and others. In 2018, Henry Louis Gates, Jr tweeted that Nigerian filmmaker and writer Onyeka Nwelue visited him in Harvard and was making a documentary film on Wole Soyinka.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He is the oldest president in U.S. history, and the first to have a female vice president. As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism, announced military support for Israel, and sent humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. In April 2023, Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election, and is now the presumptive nominee. Early life (1942–1965) Main article: Early life and career of Joe Biden Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942, at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. The oldest child in a Catholic family of English, French, and Irish descent, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James. Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946, but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old, and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton. Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work. Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten, the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield. Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle. At Archmere Academy in Claymont, Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team. Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years. He graduated in 1961. At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football, and, as an unexceptional student, earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science. Biden had a stutter and has mitigated it since his early twenties. He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror. Marriages, law school, and early career (1966–1973) Main article: Early career of Joe Biden See also: Family of Joe Biden Neilia Hunter, Joe, Hunter, Naomi Christina and Beau Biden, c. 1972 Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University, on August 27, 1966, after overcoming her parents' disinclination for her to wed a Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York. They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden. Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. He ranked 76th in a class of 85 students after failing a course because he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school. He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969. Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett in 1968 and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\". He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968. Local Republicans attempted to recruit Biden, but he registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon. In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a law firm headed by a locally active Democrat, who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party; Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat. He and another attorney also formed a law firm. Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well. He supplemented his income by managing properties. Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council in 1970 on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs. The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts. Biden won the general election, defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971. He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift. During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods. Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war. While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. Based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment in 1968; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment. 1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware Main article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware in 1972. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs and, with minimal campaign funds, he was thought to have no chance of winning. Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers, an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size. He received help from the AFL–CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell. His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\". A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points, but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage, and he won with 50.5% of the vote. Death of wife and daughter A few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware, on December 18, 1972. Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were in the car, and were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries. Biden considered resigning to care for them, but Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to. Biden contemplated suicide and was filled with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him, and had trouble focusing on work. Second marriage Biden and his second wife, Jill, met in 1975 and married in 1977.Biden met teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date. They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977. They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic. Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life. Biden is Roman Catholic and attends Mass with his wife, Jill, at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware. Their daughter, Ashley Biden, is a social worker and is married to physician Howard Krein. Beau Biden became an Army judge advocate in Iraq and later Delaware attorney general; he died of brain cancer in 2015. Hunter Biden worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings and personal life came under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency. Teaching From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law. He sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class. U.S. Senate (1973–2009) Main article: U.S. Senate career of Joe Biden Senate activities Biden with President Jimmy Carter, 1979 Biden (left) and Frank Church (middle) with president of Egypt Anwar el-Sadat after signing the Egypt–Israel peace treaty, 1979 Secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center in January 1973. Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members. At age 30, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history. To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote. He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000. As of 2024[update], he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history. During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability. In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare, but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription. Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary. Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control. After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections. He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid. In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies. In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely. Biden supported a 1976 measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. He co-sponsored a 1977 amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978. Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan, 1984 Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. He was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time. In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons, and the Violence Against Women Act, which he has called his most significant legislation. The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration; in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\". Biden meeting with attorney general Janet Reno, 1993 Biden voted for a 1993 provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces. In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same. In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges. Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers. He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton. During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers. Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it. As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security. Brain surgeries In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm. While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication. After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May, Biden's recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months. Senate Judiciary Committee Biden speaking at the signing of the 1994 Crime Bill with President Bill Clinton. Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997. As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings. When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌ given in an interview the previous year‍—‌ of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered, but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage. Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents, Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text. Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote and then in the full Senate, 42–58. During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them, and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\". After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together. Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify. The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment. The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed. Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill. In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 1997. Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009. His positions were generally liberal internationalist. He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party. During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy. Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991, siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition. Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy. The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement. Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy. In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia. He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Main article: War on terror Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004.Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\" As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat. In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. Invasion of Iraq. As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Biden eventually became a critic of the war and called his vote and role a \"mistake\" but did not push for withdrawal. He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length. By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007, saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work. Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states. Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions. In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate, but the idea failed to gain traction. 1988 and 2008 presidential campaigns 1988 campaign Main article: Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign Biden speaks at a campaign event, 1987 Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987. He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy. He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate. By August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries, and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock. Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions, but did not on two occasions in late August.: 230–232 Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship. Earlier that year, Biden had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey. Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used. A few days later, an incident in law school in which Biden drew text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations was publicized. He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks. At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules. Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class, and that he had marched in the civil rights movement. The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes. 2008 campaign Main article: Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign Biden campaigns at a house party in Creston, Iowa, July 2007. After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections. During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience. Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\" Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton. He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates. He withdrew from the race that evening. Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom, while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".: 28, 337–338 Vice presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012 2008 campaign Main articles: Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign and 2008 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection Biden speaks at the August 23, 2008, vice presidential announcement at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration. In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility, and developed a strong personal rapport. On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate. The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience. Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters. Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin. Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention. Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\" he asked.: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden. Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.: 411–414 As the financial crisis of 2007–2010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of the United States financial system became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74–25. On October 2, 2008, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall. On November 4, 2008, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain–Palin's 173. At the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate, as permitted by Delaware law. On November 4, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell. Having won both races, Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009. Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and resigned from the Senate later that day.[b] 2012 campaign Main article: Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election, but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House chief of staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton. The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama, and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea. Biden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\". Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention. Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement, and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks. Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out, while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart. The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012. An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks. Obama watching Biden debate Paul Ryan in the vice presidential debate on Air Force One In the first presidential debate of the general election, President Obama's performance was considered surprisingly lackluster. Time magazine's Joe Klein called it \"one of the most inept performances I've ever seen by a sitting president.\" Over the next few days, Obama's lead over Romney collapsed, putting pressure on Biden to stop the bleeding with a strong showing against the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan. Some political analysts considered Biden's performance against Ryan in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory over Romney. The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase \"a bunch of malarkey\" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the September 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi. Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign. On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection over Romney and Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote. Vice presidency (2009–2017) See also: Presidency of Barack Obama First term (2009–2013) Biden being sworn in as vice president on January 20, 2009 Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency. He was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States on January 20, 2009. He was the first vice president from Delaware and the first Roman Catholic vice president. Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\". Biden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible.\" Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan, but his skepticism was valued, and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy. Biden visited Iraq about every two months, becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there. More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\" By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011. President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the debt ceiling deal which led to the Budget Control Act of 2011. Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession. During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred, and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent. Biden's off-message response to a question in late April 2009, during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, led to a swift retraction by the White House. The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes. Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\" but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\" on March 23, 2010. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together. Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions. Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink. Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\" The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware. Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party. Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important. He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty. In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts. The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Biden, Obama and the national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown. The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed. Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden, lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects. Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in December 2012. Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013. It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels. Second term (2013–2017) Biden in Morocco, November 2014 Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21). Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations. Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs. He talked about sexual violence while introducing Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016, receiving a standing ovation from the audience. Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters. As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along. Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\". Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president. In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vučić, and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War. Biden with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, March 9, 2016 Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction. Role in the 2016 presidential campaign During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established. By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son Beau's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\" On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016. Subsequent activities (2017–2019) Biden with Barack Obama and Donald Trump, at the latter's inauguration on January 20, 2017 After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019, before running for president. In 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour. By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales. Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump. He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency. In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships. Biden continued to support cancer research. 2020 presidential campaign Main article: Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign Speculation and announcement Biden at his presidential kickoff rally in Philadelphia, May 2019 Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020. When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\". A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race. He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019, saying he was prompted to run because he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a \"sense of duty.\" Campaign As the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump. With Democrats keenly focused on \"electability\" for defeating Trump, this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters. It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump. In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency. Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in a political scandal and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress. In March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing. Biden had previously called himself a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him. Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he \"doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer\" and leaning forward to talk. In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\". Biden at a rally on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, February 2020 Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls. Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders. Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points. After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall. Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10. In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993. There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations. Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation. When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president. On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes. Former president Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day. On August 11, Biden announced U.S. senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket. On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election. Presidential transition Main article: Presidential transition of Joe Biden Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results. Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate. On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration. On January 6, 2021, during Congress' electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol, saying, \"We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\" Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\". After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners. Presidency (2021–present) Main article: Presidency of Joe Biden For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Joe Biden presidency. Biden takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at the Capitol, January 20, 2021. Inauguration Main article: Inauguration of Joe Biden Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021. At 78, he is the oldest person to have assumed the office. He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy) and the first president whose home state is Delaware. He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president. He is also the first president from the Silent Generation. Biden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration. First 100 days See also: First 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States, and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Biden with his Cabinet, July 2021 On March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 having been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package. Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations. Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help. On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years. In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021. Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support. On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges. On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. Domestic policy On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday. Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1983. In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated. Economy Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through June 2023 Main article: Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years. Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year. By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. In his third month in office, Biden signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, an increase of nearly 37%. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022. Amid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, reaching net negative in early 2022. After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008 before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending. Biden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress, including the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Honoring our PACT Act. Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022. The act provides billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China. Over the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers. He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure. At the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the United States hit its debt limit, which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt. Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which suspended the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default. The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden. Judiciary Further information: List of federal judges appointed by Joe Biden Biden and Ketanji Brown Jackson watching the U.S. Senate vote on her confirmation, April 2022 By the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's appointees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan. Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color. Most of his appointments have been in blue states, making a limited impact since the courts in these states already generally lean liberal. In January 2022, Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred, a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement. On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7 and sworn in on June 30. By November 2023, Biden had confirmed 150 federal judges, including 100 women. Infrastructure and climate Further information: Build Back Better Plan and Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary-general António Guterres at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 1, 2021 As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development. After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband. Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021. The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change. The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion. After Manchin rejected the bill, the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced. It was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin. The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform. According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower US greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The bill was passed by the House on August 12 and was signed by Biden on August 16. Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort. Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024. Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions. In July 2023, when the 2023 heat waves hit the U.S., Biden announced several measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change. COVID-19 diagnosis On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms. According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid. He worked in isolation in the White House for five days and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30. Other domestic policy issues In 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke cloture. The rules change failed when two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it. In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency. On July 28, 2022, the Biden administration announced it would fill four wide gaps on the Mexico–United States border in Arizona near Yuma, an area with some of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. During his presidential campaign, Biden had pledged to cease all future border wall construction. This occurred after both allies and critics of Biden criticized his administration's management of the southern border. Biden and senior advisers watch the Senate pass the CHIPS and Science Act on July 27, 2022. In the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The act's gun control provisions include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of Federal Firearms License requirements, funding for state red flag laws and other crisis intervention programs, further criminalization of arms trafficking and straw purchases, and partial closure of the boyfriend loophole. Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022. The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022. The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service. On October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of \"small\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law. On December 22, 2023, he pardoned Americans of cannabis use or possession on federal lands regardless of whether they had been charged or prosecuted. Two months after his first round of pardons, he signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages. 2022 elections Main article: 2022 United States elections Biden holding a rally at Bowie State University in Maryland for gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore, November 7, 2022 On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". Off camera, he called Trump supporters \"semi-fascists\", which Republican commentators denounced. A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.[c] It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers. Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance, and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy. Foreign policy Main article: Foreign policy of the Joe Biden administration Biden meeting with Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office, June 7, 2021 In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin. In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use. Withdrawal from Afghanistan Main article: 2020–2021 US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan Biden in a video conference with Vice President Harris and the U.S. National Security team, discussing the Fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021 American forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline. The Taliban began an offensive on May 1. By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn. Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\" On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies. He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal, with the evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies described as chaotic and botched. On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\". He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.\" On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general. On August 29, another American drone strike killed ten civilians, including seven children. The Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the suspect was harmless on September 17, calling its killing of civilians \"a tragic mistake\". The U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies \"an extraordinary success\". He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left. Ukraine Biden with refugees from Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland, March 2022 In late February 2022, after warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden led the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine. On April 29, Biden asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine, but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion. Biden blamed Vladimir Putin for the emerging energy and food crises. On February 20, 2023, four days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While there, he promised more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war. In 2022, Congress approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine. In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead, but delays in the passage of further aid by the House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024. In May 2024, Biden announced a change of American policy allowing for the use of U.S.-supplied military weapons against Russian military targets inside Russia. China Further information: China–United States relations Biden with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in Bali, November 14, 2022 China's assertiveness, particularly in the Pacific, remains a challenge for Biden. The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as Anthony Albanese succeeded to the premiership of Australia and Jacinda Ardern's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence. In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese, which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan. In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy. On February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The State Department said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations. The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had blown off course. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further waned U.S. and China relations. In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China. It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials. Israel Biden with Israeli president Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023 In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into a war, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel and condemned the attack by Hamas. He deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war, and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel. He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip. He asked Israel to pause its invasion of Gaza for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses. He also directed the U.S. military to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Biden has said he is a Zionist. As of May 2024, Biden has continued to support Israel during the course of the war despite significant domestic opposition to American involvement in it and subsequent widespread protests. A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war. It found that 36% approved \"of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza\" and 55% disapproved. Young Americans have been significantly less supportive of Israel than older generations. Beginning in April 2024, widespread Israel–Hamas war protests emerged on university campuses, denouncing Biden. On May 31, 2024, Biden announced his support for an Israeli ceasefire proposal, saying that Hamas was \"no longer capable\" of another large-scale attack. The proposal, which would establish a permanent ceasefire, release all hostages, and reconstruct the Gaza Strip, was supported by Hamas officials after mediation by Egypt and Qatar. The Netanyahu administration responded that Israel's goals regarding \"the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities\" had not changed and that conditions would need to be met before it would agree to a ceasefire. NATO enlargement Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden expressed support for the expansion of NATO to cover both Sweden and Finland. On August 9, 2022, he signed the instruments of ratification stipulating U.S. support for their mutual entry into the security pact. While Finnish ascenscion occurred on April 4, 2023, opposition by Hungary and Turkey to Swedish entry into the organization led to a stalemate. Biden led diplomatic talks between the two nations resulting in formal Swedish ascension into NATO on March 7, 2024. He has also expressed openness to Ukrainian entry into NATO following the end of the conflict. In doing so he has supported an expedited timetable in its ascension and the removal of requirements such as the Membership Action Plan typically required for NATO entry. Other foreign issues On February 4, 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. In early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State. In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks. The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding alliance. Investigations Retaining of classified documents Main article: Joe Biden classified documents incident On November 2, 2022, while packing files at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating from his vice presidency in a \"locked closet\". According to the White House, the documents were reported that day to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered them the next day. On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed U.S. attorney John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation. On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residence. The findings broke news on January 9, 2023, after CBS News published an article on the Lausch investigation. On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\". On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence. FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers and notes from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information. On February 8, 2024, Hur concluded the special counsel investigation and announced that no charges would be brought against Biden. Business activities Main article: United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family Further information: Impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden On January 11, 2023, the House of Representatives launched an investigative committee into the foreign business activities of Biden's son, Hunter, and brother, James. The committee's chair, Representative James Comer, simultaneously investigated alleged corruption related to the Hunter Biden laptop controversy. On September 12, House speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that the recent House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" by Biden and his family. Congressional investigations, most notably by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden as of December 2023.[d] On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221–212 to formalize an impeachment inquiry into Biden. 2024 presidential campaign Main article: Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign Ending months of speculation, on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate. The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign. On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent. Most of those surveyed in the poll said the economy was their biggest concern. During his campaign, Biden has promoted higher economic growth and recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. He has frequently stated his intention to \"finish the job\" as a political rallying cry. 2024 primaries Main article: 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote. He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote. Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan, with \"none of these candidates\" and \"uncommitted\" coming in second in each state, respectively. On March 5 (\"Super Tuesday\"), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13 of them. On March 12, he reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee. Political positions Main article: Political positions of Joe Biden Mikhail Gorbachev (right) being introduced to President Obama by Joe Biden, March 2009. U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul is pictured in the background. Pope Francis (left) meets Joe Biden at the White House, September 2015. As a senator, Biden was regarded as a moderate Democrat. As a presidential nominee, Biden's platform was the most progressive of any major party platform in history, although not within his party's ideological vanguard. Biden says his positions are deeply influenced by Catholic social teaching. According to political scientist Carlo Invernizzi Accetti, \"it has become second nature to describe his politics with such ready-made labels as centrist or moderate.\" Accetti says that Biden represents an Americanized form of Christian democracy, taking positions characteristic of both the center-right and center-left. Biden has cited the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, credited with starting the Christian democratic movement, as immensely influential in his thinking. Other analysts have likened his ideology to traditional liberalism, \"a doctrine of liberty, equality, justice and individual rights that relies, in the modern age, on a strong federal government for enforcement\". Such analysts distinguish liberals, who believe in a regulated market economy, from the left, who believe in greater economic intervention or a command economy. In 2022, journalist Sasha Issenberg wrote that Biden's \"most valuable political skill\" was \"an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic Party\". Biden has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire. But he supports raising the corporate tax only up to 28% from the 21% established in the 2017 bill, not back to 35%, the corporate tax rate until 2017. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts. Biden's plan aims to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option. Biden did not support national same-sex marriage rights while in the Senate and voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, but opposed proposals for constitutional amendments that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide. Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012. As a senator, Biden forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed. In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing cannabis, after advocating harsher penalties for drug use as a U.S. senator. Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden supports nature conservation. According to a report from the Center for American Progress, he broke several records in this domain. He took steps to protect Old-growth forests. Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050. His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, green building and more. Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice and ocean justice, and has taken steps to implement it. A major step is increasing energy efficiency, water efficiency and resilience to climate disasters in low-income houses for mitigate climate change, reduce costs, improve health and safety. Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the \"only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war\". Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a \"War on American Energy\", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023. Biden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China, calling it the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\". Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression. Biden has said he is against regime change, but for providing non-military support to opposition movements. He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya, voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War, voted in favor of the Iraq War, and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia. Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides. In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[e] Biden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency, though he personally opposes abortion because of his Catholic faith. In 2019, he said he supported Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment. After Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states, and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States. He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of Roe into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster. Public image Main article: Public image of Joe Biden Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate, which he attributed to his having been elected young. Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term. As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012. By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency. Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much, much better.\" Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself\". In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief. In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies. Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious; journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for \"talking too much\", leaning in close \"like an old pal with something urgent to tell you\". He often deviates from prepared remarks and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth\". Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes and in 2018 called himself \"a gaffe machine\". The New York Times wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything.\" Joe Biden's 81st birthday cake Joe Biden is the oldest sitting president in United States history. During his presidency, Republicans, Democrats, and pundits raised questions about Biden's cognitive health in reaction to his publicized gaffes. Biden has repeatedly said that he is fit for the presidency. According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by The New Yorker in 2014. For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees. The Times wrote, \"Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.\" Job approval See also: 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 opinion polling on the Joe Biden administration According to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50 percent in the first eight months of his presidency. In August 2021, it began to decline, and it reached the low forties by December. This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics. According to Gallup, Biden averaged 41 percent approval in his second year in office, and 39.8 percent in his third year. In February 2021, Gallup, Inc. reported that 98 percent of Democrats approved of Biden. As of December 2023, that number had declined to 78 percent. His approval rating among Republicans reached a high of 12 percent in February 2021 and again in July 2021. Biden ended 2023 with a job approval rating of 39 percent, the lowest of any modern U.S. president after three years in office.

Kaufman said he would serve only two years, until Delaware's special Senate election in 2010. Biden's son Beau ruled himself out of the 2008 selection process due to his impending tour in Iraq with the Delaware Army National Guard. He was a possible candidate for the 2010 special election, but in early 2010 said he would not run for the seat. ^ Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, whose seats were not up for election in 2022, left the Democratic Party and became independent politicians in December 2022 and May 2024, respectively. As a result, 47 Democrats (rather than 49), plus Angus King and Bernie Sanders, independents who caucus with Democrats, were in the Senate of the 118th United States Congress, on May 31, 2024. Manchin continues to caucus with Democrats while Sinema has opted to caucus with neither party but to align with the Democrats, bringing the Democratic Senate majority to 51 seats. ^ Attributed to multiple sources: ^ In 1981, President Ronald Reagan referred to the Armenian genocide in passing in a statement regarding The Holocaust, but never made a formal declaration recognizing it.

This article is about the supposed torture device. For the band, see Iron Maiden. For other uses, see Iron Maiden (disambiguation). Various neo-medieval torture instruments. An iron maiden stands at the right. The iron maiden is a medieval torture device, consisting of a solid iron cabinet with a hinged front and spike-covered interior, sufficiently tall to enclose a human being. The first stories citing the iron maiden were composed in the 19th century. The use of iron maidens is considered to be a myth, heightened by the belief that people of the Middle Ages were uncivilized; evidence of their actual use has never been found. They have become a popular image in media involving the Middle Ages and involving torture chambers. History[edit] An open iron maiden Despite its reputation as a medieval instrument of torture, there is no evidence of the existence of iron maidens before the 19th century. There are, however, ancient reports of the Spartan tyrant Nabis using a similar device around 200 B.C. for extortion and murder. The Abbasid vizier Ibn al-Zayyat is said to have created a \"wooden oven-like chest that had iron spikes\" for torture, which would ironically be used during his own imprisonment and execution in 847. Wolfgang Schild, a professor of criminal law, criminal law history, and philosophy of law at the Bielefeld University, has argued that putative iron maidens were pieced together from artifacts found in museums to create spectacular objects intended for (commercial) exhibition. Several 19th-century iron maidens are on display in museums around the world, including the Museum of Us, the Meiji University Museum, and several torture museums in Europe. Possible inspirations[edit] The 19th-century iron maidens may have been constructed as a misinterpretation of a medieval Schandmantel, which was made of wood and metal but without spikes. Inspiration for the iron maiden may also have come from the Carthaginian execution of Marcus Atilius Regulus as recorded in Tertullian's \"To the Martyrs\" (Chapter 4) and Augustine of Hippo's The City of God (I.15), in which the Carthaginians \"shut him into a tight wooden box, where he was forced to stand, spiked with the sharpest nails on all sides so that he could not lean in any direction without being pierced,\" or from Polybius' account of Nabis of Sparta's deadly statue of his wife, the Iron Apega (earliest form of the device). The iron maiden of Nuremberg[edit] Copy of the iron maiden of Nuremberg on display in Rothenburg ob der Tauber The most famous iron maiden that popularized the design was that of Nuremberg, first displayed possibly as far back as 1802. The original was lost in the Allied bombing of Nuremberg in 1945. A copy \"from the Royal Castle of Nuremberg\", crafted for public display, was sold through J. Ichenhauser of London to the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1890 along with other torture devices, and, after being displayed at the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois, 1893, was taken on an American tour. This copy was auctioned in the early 1960s and is now on display at the Medieval Crime Museum, Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Origins[edit] Some historians have argued that Johann Philipp Siebenkees (1759–1796) made up the history of the device. According to Siebenkees' colportage, it was first used on August 14, 1515, to execute a coin forger.

In Ecuador, while Quichua holds no official status, it is a recognized language under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In Bolivia, Aymara , Quechua and Guaraní hold official status alongside Spanish. Guaraní, like Spanish, is an official language of Paraguay, and is spoken by a majority of the population, which is, for the most part, bilingual, and it is co-official with Spanish in the Argentine province of Corrientes . In Nicaragua, Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and Indigenous languages such as Miskito , Sumo , and Rama also hold official status. Colombia recognizes all Indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages.

(August 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Below is an alphabetical list of widely used and repeated proverbial phrases. If known, their origins are noted. A proverbial phrase or expression is a type of conventional saying similar to a proverb and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed expression, while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context. In 1768, John Ray defined a proverbial phrase as: A proverb [or proverbial phrase] is usually defined, an instructive sentence, or common and pithy saying, in which more is generally designed than expressed, famous for its peculiarity or elegance, and therefore adopted by the learned as well as the vulgar, by which it is distinguished from counterfeits which want such authority— John Ray, A Compleat Collection of English Proverbs, 1798 Contents: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z References A[edit] A bad excuse is better than none A bad penny always turns up A bad workman blames his tools A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush A cat may look at a king A chain is only as strong as its weakest link A dog is a man's best friend A drowning man will clutch at a straw A fool and his money are soon parted A friend in need (is a friend indeed) A friend to everyone is a friend to no one A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step A little learning is a dangerous thing A leopard cannot change its spots A man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills A mill cannot grind with the water that is past A miss is as good as a mile A new language is a new life (Persian proverb) A penny saved is a penny earned A picture is worth a thousand words A rising tide lifts all boats A rolling stone gathers no moss A ship in a harbour is safe, but that's not what a ship is for A stitch in time (saves nine) A watched man never plays A watched pot/kettle never boils Absence makes the heart grow fonder[a] Absolute power corrupts absolutely (John Dalberg-Acton, 1887)[a] Accidents will happen (in the best-regulated families)[a] Actions speak louder than words[a][b] Adversity makes strange bedfellows[a] All good things come to him who waits[a] All good things must come to an end[a][b] All hands on deck/to the pump All is grist that comes to the mill[a] All roads lead to Rome[a][b] All that glitters/glistens is not gold[a][b] All the world loves a lover[a] All things come to those who wait[a] All things must pass[a] All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy[a][b] All you need is love All is fair in love and war[a] All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds[a] All is well that ends well[a] An apple a day keeps the doctor away[a] An army marches on its stomach An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind (Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948), leader of the Indian independence movement) An Englishman's home is his castle/A man's home is his castle[a] Another day, another dollar Another happy landing An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure[a] Any port in a storm[a][b] Any publicity is good publicity[a] April showers bring forth May flowers[a][b] As a tree bends, so shall it grow As the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined As you make your bed, so you must lie upon it[a] As you sow so shall you reap[a] Ask a silly question and you will get a silly answer[a] Ask my companion if I be a thief[b] Ask no questions and hear no lies[a] Attack is the best form of defense At the end of my rope[a] B[edit] Bad news travels fast[a] Barking dogs seldom bite[a][b] Beauty is in the eye of the beholder[a] Beauty is only skin deep[a][b] Beggars cannot be choosers[a][b] Behind every great man, there is a great woman[a] Better late than never[a] Better safe than sorry[a] Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven[a] Be yourself[a] Better the Devil you know (than the Devil you do not)[a] Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all[a] Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness[a] Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt[a] Better wear out than rust out[b] Beware of Greeks bearing gifts (Trojan War, Virgil in the Aeneid) Big fish eat little fish[a] Birds of a feather (flock together)[a] Blood is thicker than water Born with a silver spoon in one's mouth Boys will be boys[a] Brevity is the soul of wit (William Shakespeare)[a][b] Business before pleasure[a] C[edit] Caesar's wife must be above suspicion[a] Careless talk costs lives Charity begins at home[a] Cheats never prosper[a] Cheese, wine, and friends must be old to be good.

                    "website_data": "Criticism of the concept Larry Kusche Larry Kusche Larry Kusche , author of The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved (1975), argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman Donald Crowhurst , which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an Atlantic port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the Pacific Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories. Larry Kusche The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved Donald Crowhurst Atlantic Pacific Kusche concluded that: The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean. In an area frequented by tropical cyclones , the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, neither disproportionate, unlikely, nor mysterious. Furthermore, Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms or even represent the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this. The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been. Some disappearances had, in fact, never happened. One plane crash was said to have taken place in 1937, off Daytona Beach , Florida, in front of hundreds of witnesses. The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism .

Daytona Beach The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism . sensationalism Further responses Further responses When the British Channel 4 television program The Bermuda Triangle (1992) was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the Equinox series, the marine insurance market Lloyd's of London was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there. Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. United States Coast Guard records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis. Channel 4 The Bermuda Triangle Equinox Lloyd's of London United States Coast Guard The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker V. A. Fogg , the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies, in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup. In addition, V. A. Fogg sank off the coast of Texas , nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle. V. A. Fogg V. A. Fogg V. A. Fogg Texas The Nova / Horizon episode The Case of the Bermuda Triangle , aired on 27 June 1976, was highly critical, stating that \"When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place ... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world.\" Nova Nova Horizon Horizon The Case of the Bermuda Triangle Skeptical researchers , such as Ernest Taves and Barry Singer, have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint. Skeptical researchers In a 2013 study, the World Wide Fund for Nature identified the world's 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them. World Wide Fund for Nature Benjamin Radford , an author and scientific paranormal investigator, noted in an interview on the Bermuda Triangle that it could be very difficult locating an aircraft lost at sea due to the vast search area, and although the disappearance might be mysterious, that did not make it paranormal or unexplainable. Radford further noted the importance of double-checking information as the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle had been created by people who had neglected to do so. Benjamin Radford ",

Contents 1 Misquoted or misattributed 2 Unsourced, unverified, or other best guesses 3 Commonly misquoted 3.1 People 4 References Misquoted or misattributed[edit] \"A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.\" Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, Thomas Jefferson, Ann Landers, et al. never said these words. The phrase is an alteration of one made by Jonathan Swift: Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it. \"Hell is just a frame of mind\": widely claimed on the internet to be a quotation from Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus. The demon Mephistopheles in Doctor Faustus does, however, imply a similar idea by saying that losing his place in heaven makes him experience hell, by comparison, wherever he is: \"Why this is hell, nor am I out of it. Think'st thou that I who saw the face of God, And tasted the eternal joys of Heaven, Am not tormented with ten thousand hells, In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?\" \"If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.\" George Bernard Shaw never said these words, but Charles F. Brannan did. \"The secret of all victory lies in the organization of the non-obvious\" Widely attributed to Marcus Aurelius, this quote appears in The Decline of the West, by Oswald Spengler (1918 and 1923). \"I don't think we're in Kansas anymore, Toto.\", Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (played by Judy Garland) This phrase was never uttered by the character. What she really said was Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more. \"In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things, charity\" (In necessariis unitas, in non-necessariis [or, dubiis] libertas, in utrisque [or, omnibus] caritas). Widely attributed to Augustine, but the phrase was coined by Rupertus Meldenius, a Lutheran theologian and educator, in 1626. \"A stupid person's idea of a clever person\", Julie Burchill of Stephen Fry. This phrase was coined by the Irish writer Elizabeth Bowen about Aldous Huxley in the 1930s. Burchill remarked that \"My husband claims that it was I who coined the line about Stephen Fry that he is \"a stupid person's idea of a clever person\". And if I weren't a sober person's idea of a booze-addled person, I might be more useful in remembering whether this is true or not. Whatever, it's pretty damn good.\" \"Not many people know that.\", Michael Caine, British actor. A comment by actor/comedian Peter Sellers while impersonating Caine who has become associated with the quote, although he never said it. \"Nice guys finish last.\" Leo Durocher (1906–1991), US baseball manager. As reported in the biography, Nice Guys Finish Last, (by Leo Durocher, with Ed Linn, Simon & Schuster, 1975), Durocher's remark was his reply to being asked his opinion of the 1946 New York Giants. He actually said, \"Take a look at them. All nice guys. They'll finish last. Nice guys – finish last.\" Elision of the relative pronoun (\"who\") in the final sentence turned an evaluation into a declaration that nice people are doomed to failure. \"The two most common elements in the Universe are Hydrogen and Stupidity.\" Harlan Ellison (born May 27, 1934), US author. Although stated by Ellison in a nonfiction essay in the mid-1960s, this quote has been frequently misattributed to Frank Zappa. In Zappa's autobiography, The Real Frank Zappa Book (1989), on page 239, Zappa makes a similar comment: \"Some scientists claim that hydrogen, because it is so plentiful, is the basic building block of the universe. I dispute that. I say there is more stupidity than hydrogen, and that is the basic building block of the universe.\" \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\" Voltaire Thought to be words of Voltaire; it was actually written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall. \"To learn who rules over you, simply find out whom you are not allowed to criticize.\" Voltaire A similar quote is noted in a 1993 polemic by Kevin Strom, a neo-Nazi writer who used the phrase in reference to the Gay Mafia. Strom, in turn, attributed the phrase to a 1960s speech by academic-turned-white supremacist Revilo P. Oliver. \"If I can't dance I don't want to be in [or a part of] your revolution.\" (also: \"If I can't dance to it, it's not my revolution\") Widely attributed to Emma Goldman, but according to Goldman scholar Alix Kates Shulman, it was instead the invention of anarchist printer Jack Frager for a small batch of Goldman T-shirts he printed in 1973. In her memoirs, Goldman remembers being censured for dancing and states: \"I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to become a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. 'I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things.'\" – Living My Life (New York: Knopf, 1934), p. 56 In the motion picture V for Vendetta, V (played by Hugo Weaving) says that \"a revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having.\" See Shulman, Alix Kates Dances With Feminists, Women's Review of Books, Vol. IX, no. 3, December 1991. \"Just the facts, ma'am.\" This, the best known quote from the Jack Webb series Dragnet, was never said by Sgt. Friday in any of the Dragnet radio or television series. The quote was, however, adopted in the 1987 Dragnet pseudo-parody film starring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks in which Aykroyd played Sgt. Joe Friday. Correct versions:\"All we want are the facts, ma'am.\"\"All we know are the facts, ma'am.\" See Mikkelson, Barbara and David P. (29 March 2002). Just the Facts. Urban Legends. snopes.com.

I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization. Usually misattributed to Petronius Arbiter Actually by Charlton Ogburn (1911–1998) from \"Merrill's Marauders: The truth about an incredible adventure\" in the January 1957 issue of Harper's Magazine Actual quote: \"We trained hard, but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganized. Presumably the plans for our employment were being changed. I was to learn later in life that, perhaps because we are so good at organizing, we tend as a nation to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization.\" see Brown, David S. \"Petronius or Ogburn?\", Public Administration Review, Vol. 38, No. 3 (May – June, 1978), p. 296 \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" – Sherlock Holmes This phrase was never uttered by the character in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's written works. Though \"Elementary,\" and \"...my dear Watson.\" both appear near the beginning of The Crooked Man (1893), it is the \"...my dear Watson\" that appears first, and \"Elementary\" is the succinct reply to Watson's exclamation a few lines of dialogue later. This is the closest these four immortal words ever appear together in the Canon. The first documented occurrence of this quote appears in the P. G. Wodehouse novel, \"Psmith, Journalist\", which was serialized in The Captain magazine (1909-10) then published in book form (1915) and contains the following dialogue: \"That's right,\" said Billy Windsor. \"Of course.\" \"Elementary, my dear Watson, elementary,\" murmured Psmith. The end justifies the means. Often misattributed to Machiavelli's The Prince, in which the idea appears, but not the phrase itself, and to many other writers who repeat this aphorism at least as old as Ovid, Heroides (c. 10 BC): Exitus acta probat. See also: Means and ends. \"There's a sucker born every minute.\" While this is often attributed to P. T. Barnum, it seems to have been said by one of his competitors, commenting on one of Barnum's exhibits. See: There's a sucker born every minute On the whole, I would rather be in Philadelphia. Misattributed to W. C. Fields Actual quote: \"Here Lies W. C. Fields: I would rather be living in Philadelphia.\" Presented as one of \"A group of artists [writing] their own epitaphs\" in a 1925 issue of Vanity Fair, which may or may not have been written by the figures whose names appear with the epitaphs. In the movie My Little Chickadee, Fields' character is about to be hanged. With the noose around his neck, he makes his last request to the lynching party. \"I'd like to see Paris before I die.\" As the noose starts to tighten, he adds \"Philadelphia will do!\" see Amory, Cleveland, and Bradlee, Frederic, Vanity Fair: Selections from America's Most Memorable Magazine, a Cavalcade of the 1920s and 1930s, Viking Press, 1960, page 103. \"I invented the internet.\" Misattributed to Al Gore. In fact, Al Gore did not claim to have \"invented\" the internet. This is a distortion of statements in which Gore claims credit for his role within Congress in funding the internet's development. While popularized by Gore's political opponents as a quote from Gore, the initial use of the word \"invented\" in this context was by Wired News author Declan McCullagh, who in turn was paraphrasing House Majority Leader Armey's criticism of Gore's claims. The correct Gore quote from CNN's Late Edition: \"During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.\" Finkelstein, Seth (28 April 2006). Al Gore \"invented the Internet\" – resources. sethf.com. Retrieved on 2011-6-16. \"Theirs but to do or die!\" This is a misstatement of a line from Tennyson's \"The Charge Of The Light Brigade\", which actually says, \"Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die\". See w:The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem) \"Far from the maddening crowd\" This is a misstatement of a line from Thomas Gray's poem \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" (1751): \"Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife, Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray.\" The line was later used by Thomas Hardy as the title of his novel \"Far From The Madding Crowd\". See http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/134150.html \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" This is often erroneously assumed to be the quote of Ben Parker dating back to the original Spider-Man origin story as depicted in 1962's Amazing Fantasy #15. This statement appears as a caption of narration in the last panel of the story and was not a spoken line by any character in the story. In most retellings of Spider-Man's origin, including the 2002 film, the quote has been retconned (the alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work) to depict Uncle Ben's final lecture to Peter Parker before Ben's tragic death and as the words that continue to drive Peter as Spider-Man. Also, the correct Amazing Fantasy quote is, \"With great power there must also come great responsibility.\" \"It's life, Jim, but not as we know it.\" Attributed to Leonard McCoy from the run of Star Trek: The Original Series, but the phrase was never uttered. The similar phrase \"not life as we know it\" is spoken by Spock in the season one episode \"The Devil in the Dark\". The spurious phrase originated in the 1987 novelty song \"Star Trekkin'\", in which the quote is attributed to Spock. McCoy's line in the song was, \"It's worse than that, he's dead, Jim!\" See: The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations, 2007 edition (Oxford University Press), entry by Elizabeth Knowles; ISBN 978-0-19-920895-1 \"We sleep safely in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would harm us.\" Alternative: \"People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\" Alternative: \"We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.\" Commonly misattributed to George Orwell without citation. Sometimes also misattributed to Winston Churchill without citation. Actual source: Quote Investigator found the earliest known appearance in a 1993 Washington Times essay by Richard Grenier: \"As George Orwell pointed out, people sleep peacefully in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\" The absence of quotation marks indicates that Grenier was using his own words to convey his interpretation of Orwell's opinion, as seen in citations below. In his 1945 \"Notes on Nationalism\", Orwell wrote that pacifists cannot accept the statement \"Those who 'abjure' violence can do so only because others are committing violence on their behalf.\", despite it being \"grossly obvious.\"\"Notes on Nationalism\" In an essay on Rudyard Kipling, Orwell cited Kipling's phrase \"making mock of uniforms that guard you while you sleep\" (Kipling, Tommy), and further noted that Kipling's \"grasp of function, of who protects whom, is very sound. He sees clearly that men can be highly civilized only while other men, inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them.\" (1942) Similar phrase: \"I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it.\" – Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) \"Well-behaved women rarely make history.\" Often attributed to actress Marilyn Monroe, the quote was actually written by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, historian and professor at Harvard University. Thatcher Ulrich's original statement, \"Well-behaved women seldom make history\", appeared in an academic article published in 1976. The use of the phrase in her original article, which concerned well-behaved women commemorated in Puritan funeral sermons, was commenting on how the domestic, 'ordinary' lives of historical women has not been widely known or studied deeply by historians. See: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/09/ulrich-explains-that-well-behaved-women-should-make-history/ \"Well, that escalated quickly.\" Was said by Ron Burgundy following a fight with local anchormen. The correct quote is \"Boy, that escalated quickly\". See: Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy \"Please, Sir, can I have some more?\" Commonly thought to be said by Oliver Twist in the parish workhouse. The correct quote is \"Please, Sir, I want some more\". \"The harder he works, the luckier he gets.\" Variations are frequently attributed to Donald Trump or his wife in interview, but the phrase originated with Samuel Goldwyn as \"The harder I work, the luckier I get.\", but he was believed to be paraphrasing the quote below. \"I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.\" There is no record that this was said or written by Thomas Jefferson. . Its first print appearance is by F. L. Emerson in 1947. \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of 99, wear sunscreen.\" The Wear Sunscreen speech is regularly attributed to Kurt Vonnegut or Baz Luhrmann, but it was originally written in 1997 as a newspaper column by Mary Schmich as a semi-parodic \"Guide to Life for Students\". \"If the mountain won't come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain.\" Often attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad but there is no evidence that he actually said this. This phrase actually originates in a retelling of the story of Muhammad by Francis Bacon in 1625: \"Mahomet cald the Hill to come to him. And when the Hill stood still, he was neuer a whit abashed, but said; If the Hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet wil go to the Hill.\" The original phrase used the term \"hill\", but John Owen's 1643 translation used the term \"mountain\". This phrase is often misquoted due to widespread misunderstanding of the phrase's meaning. It does not refer to \"going after opportunity instead of waiting for it to come to you\". Its meaning translates, \"If one's will does not prevail, one must submit to an alternative.\" \"A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.\" Attributed to Everett Dirksen. Dirksen occasionally used the phrase \"a billion here, a billion there\" in his speeches, but the latter appendage was apparently the work of a newspaper reporter. Dirksen noted that although he never said the whole comment, he liked the misquotation and never seriously objected to its misattribution. \"I will return and I will be millions.\" This is often attributed to Eva Perón, and indeed is on her tombstone, but there is no record she said it. The belief that she actually did is probably because she does in a José María Castiñeira de Dios poem written in her voice nearly ten years after her 1952 death. Túpac Katari, a leader of the Bolivian indigenous people's rebellion against Spanish rule, did in fact say something similar (\"I shall die but return tomorrow multiplied ten thousandfold\") before his 1781 execution; more recently, a slave in Howard Fast's contemporary novel Spartacus says the line as he is being crucified and the line is repeated in the 1960 Stanley Kubrick film version. \"I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while!\" Attributed to Groucho Marx. According to urban legend, while interviewing Marion and Charlotte Story for a 1950 episode of You Bet Your Life, Marx uttered the phrase in response to Charlotte, who had mothered 20 children with her husband, saying how much she loved her husband. According to surviving recordings of the episode in question, Marx actually said \"With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?\" Although episodes of You Bet Your Life were known to be edited for content, Marx himself denied ever saying the more risqué phrase. In another known episode with a child who was among 17 siblings, Groucho asked the girl what her father thought of having such a large family; when she responded that her father loves children, he replied \"Well, I like pancakes, but I haven't got a closet full of them!\" A conflation of this exchange with that of the Story family may have been the source of the more ribald misquotation. \"Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing.\" Vince Lombardi always insisted he had never said this, although it is close to a line he did frequently repeat: \"Winning isn't a sometime thing; it's an all the time thing.\" The actual line was spoken by former UCLA football coach Henry Russell \"Red\" Sanders. \"I cannot allow your ignorance, however great, to take precedence over my knowledge, however small.\" Versions of this are attributed to William James. A version of this was apparently spoken by Leonard Bacon, although the earliest known source is from 1898, seven years after Bacon's death, and there is significant variation between the wording of these and other early sources. Bacon's great-grandson confirms a version of this quotation in his own autobiography. The misattribution to James might originate, ironically, from the 1994 book Telling the Truth about History by Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, & Margaret Jacob, p. 258. \"Good things come to those who wait.\" English poet Violet Fane originally stated \"All things come to he who waits (...) they come, but often come too late.\" The adage may have existed before Fane wrote it. It has been notably corrupted twice: first by Guinness beer in its best-known form, and by Heinz, a condiment company, as \"The best things come to those who wait.\" \"I can't believe Nixon won. I don't know anyone who voted for him.\" Allegedly from film critic Pauline Kael. Kael did state in a December 1972 speech: \"I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for Nixon. Where they are I don't know. They're outside my ken.\" \"We buy things we don't need with money we don't have to impress people we don't like.\" Often presented as a line from the movie Fight Club. Although consistent with the film's anti-consumerist philosophy, neither the quote nor any variation of it is ever uttered in the movie or the original novel.[dubious? – discuss] The original quote, \"Spending money you don't have for things you don't need to impress people you don't like\", is attributed to Walter Slezak was in the 4th June 1928 Detroit Free Press (thirty years before Slezak), where the American humorist and journalist Robert Quillen, though elements of the quote appeared earlier. In that column, he defined “Americanism” as “using money you haven’t earned to buy things you don’t need to impress people you don’t like.” The novel does contain the line \"A lot of young people try to impress the world and buy too many things\", and at one point in the film the character played by Brad Pitt says \"Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.\" In the Internet age the quote has been adapted as \"We post content that isn't ours for likes that aren't real to impress people we don't know.\" \"The British are coming\" Paul Revere did not shout this phrase which is attributed to him: his mission depended on secrecy, the countryside was filled with British army patrols, and most of the Massachusetts colonists (who were predominantly English in ethnic origin) still considered themselves British. Revere's warning, according to eyewitness accounts of the ride and Revere's own descriptions, was \"The Regulars are coming out.\" The Shaggs are better than the Beatles. Popularly misattributed to musician and outsider music auteur Frank Zappa. The description of The Shaggs, a notoriously inept garage rock girl group from the 1960s, as being \"better than the Beatles\" was actually the work of Lester Bangs. Zappa did hold the group in high regard, despite not using the phrase. A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's written on. (Samuel Goldwyn) One of many quirky Goldwynisms, this is a corruption of Goldwyn's actual quote praising a friend's trustworthy nature: \"His verbal contract is worth more than the paper it's written on.\" Don't worry, be happy. Though Bob Marley had included similar sentiments in his own songs, particularly in \"Three Little Birds,\" he never recorded the song by this name. The phrase itself was coined by Meher Baba; the song by that name was written and recorded by Bobby McFerrin six years after Marley's death. Ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning. Neither Howard Cosell nor Keith Jackson uttered this quote during their telecast of the 1977 World Series. The phrase \"the Bronx is burning\" originated five years earlier in an episode of Man Alive describing fiscal shortfalls at fire stations in the Bronx, then later misattributed to Cosell and Jackson after the World Series telecast, which featured footage of a school building burning in-between game action. Writing about music is like dancing about architecture. Neither Elvis Costello nor Laurie Anderson originated this quote. Variations of the quote have appeared in print since as early as 1918 and attributed to several different people. Phenomenon (do, doo, do-do-doo) Although the song referred to by this name appeared several times on the Muppet Show, it is originally by Piero Umiliani and was used as part of the soundtrack for an softcore porn film. The original song title and lyrics both read \"Mahna Mahna\", which is meaningless; \"phenomenon\" was added on a much later Muppet Show version of the song as a pun on the original. Unsourced, unverified, or other best guesses[edit] These may not necessarily be misquotations but catchphrases from popular culture, whose formation required slight alterations to put them into context and make them memorable. \"A house that has a library in it has a soul.\" Attributed to Plato by Robert G. Ingersoll in \"The Liberty Of All\" (1877), but it does not appear in Plato's writings. \"Hell is the truth seen too late.\" Attributed to Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan, but it is not there. \"No rest for the wicked.\" Probably a corruption of Isaiah 57:21: \"There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\" \"Lies, damned lies and statistics\" Popularized by Mark Twain in 1906, he mistakenly attributed the phrase to Benjamin Disraeli. A variant of the phrase, which divided witnesses into \"liars, damned liars and experts,\" is first noted in late 1885, with the phrase in its best-known form, used instead to describe categories of falsehoods, in common parlance by 1891. There survives no clear evidence as to who coined the phrase in either form. \"For sale: baby shoes, never worn.\" This six-word piece of flash fiction was only attributed to Ernest Hemingway decades after he died. The earliest reference to a similar phrase, in a nonfiction work (a newspaper reporting the death of a young child in 1910), notes: \"Baby's handmade trousers and baby's bed for sale. Never been used.\" \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\" A quote allegedly made by Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto regarding the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, first used in the 1970 film Tora! Tora! Tora! and again in the 2001 film Pearl Harbor. While this quote may have encapsulated his sentiments regarding the attack, there is no printed evidence to prove Yamamoto made this statement or wrote it down. \"Mate, how does it feel to have dropped the World Cup?\" Allegedly by Steve Waugh to Herschelle Gibbs when Gibbs dropped a now infamous catch that eventually assisted in South Africa being knocked out of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Although some Australian cricketers claim they heard this exchange, Waugh himself denies it was said. \"Because it's there\" George Mallory on why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. Questions have been raised about the authenticity of this quote. It may have been invented by a newspaper reporter. \"It's a funny old game\" Jimmy Greaves' autobiography Greavsie insists that, despite this quote regularly being attributed to him, he has never used it. The misquotation may arise from a trailer for the Central Television programme Spitting Image during the mid-1980s. \"Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" This misquote hearkens back to the British Lord Acton, a 19th century English historian who was commenting about tyrannical monarchs (Caesar, Henry VIII, Napoleon, various Russian tsars, etc.). Lord Acton actually wrote: \"Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.\" \"Beam me up, Scotty\" – James T. Kirk From the Star Trek science fiction television series. Several variants of this occur in the series, such as \"Energize\", \"Beam me aboard,\" \"Beam us up home,\" or \"Two to beam up,\" but \"Beam me up, Scotty\" was never said during the run of the original Star Trek series. However, the quote \"Beam us up, Scotty\" was uttered in Star Trek: The Animated Series. The movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home included the closest other variation: \"Scotty, beam me up.\" James Doohan, the actor who played Scotty, chose this phrase as the title of his 1996 autobiography. \"Damn it, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a...\" – Leonard McCoy From the Star Trek science fiction television series. McCoy had several lines of this sort, except that he never said \"damn it\". Only one \"swear word\" was used on the original Star Trek series (before the movies): \"hell\". It was most famously spoken at the end of the episode entitled \"City on the Edge of Forever\": \"Let's get the hell out of here\" – J. T. Kirk. The phrase, complete with \"damn it\" probably originated from Dan Aykroyd's Dr. McCoy impersonation during a skit on Saturday Night Live season 1 episode 22; although McCoy did eventually end up saying, \"Damn it, Jim\" in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, followed directly by, \"what the hell's the matter with you?\" Used in Star Trek (2009). \"All that glistens is not gold\" / \"All that glitters is not gold\" – William Shakespeare Correct quote: \"All that glisters is not gold\". Often (usually) misquoted. Spoken by the Prince of Morocco in The Merchant of Venice In the opening verse to Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" quotes \"There's a lady who's sure, all that glitters is gold.\" The line \"All that is gold does not glitter\" is the opening of a poem in \"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\", referring to the character Aragorn, who \"looks foul and feels fair\". In the chorus of the Smash Mouth song \"All Star\" can be found the phrase \"All that glitters is gold\". \"Blood, Sweat, and Tears\" – Winston Churchill Correct quote: \"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\" The quote appeared in the book Metropolis, written by Thea von Harbou (wife of Metropolis director Fritz Lang), first published in 1926. The text, describing Freder Fredersen as he has just finished his first day working to keep the machines of Metropolis alive, states, \"He tasted a salty taste on his lips, and did not know if it was from blood, sweat, or tears.\" Notes: A similar quote from Winston Churchill can be found in a recorded speech he gave to the House of Commons where he says \" I have never promised anything but blood, sweat and tears, now however we have a new experience. We have victory. a..a remarkable victory. A bright gleam has caught the helmets of our soldiers and warmed and cheered all our hearts.\" The song from the movie The Longest Day says: \" [...] Filled with hopes and filled with fears. Filled with blood and sweat and tears [...]\" Blood, Sweat and Tears is the name of the 1963 album from Johnny Cash, which inspired the name for the music group formed in 1967, and may be the source of confusion. Blood, Sweat and Tears is a song from South Korean boy group BTS, released in 2016. \"God helps those who help themselves.\" The saying is not Biblical, but it is an ancient proverb that shows up in the literature of many cultures, including a 1736 edition of Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac. \"There is a Rabbinic saying: \"One who comes to be purified is helped.\" which is quite similar. This is more or less identical to the message in one of the Aesop's fables, about a man praying to Hercules--the fable \"Heracles and the Driver\" The moral to this fable is \"The gods help those who help themselves\" This is a likely origin as the fable is well known and the moral is the closest to the actual phrase. The saying is also found in Xenophon's masterpiece about Cyrus, Cyropaedia. Pretty much the motto on the coat of arms of Huddersfield, England 'Juvat impigros deus'. Strictly speaking, God helps the industrious, but locally translated as \"God helps those who help themselves\". This is similar to the Quranic quote \"...Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves...\" in Surat Al-Ra'd verse 11. \"Lead on, Macduff\" Correct quote: \"Lay on, Macduff, and damned be him who first cries 'Hold! enough!'\" – William Shakespeare (Macbeth) Use of \"Lead on, Macduff\" is documented as early as 1855. \"Bubble bubble, toil and trouble.\" Correct quote: \"Double, double toil and trouble.\" – William Shakespeare (Macbeth) \"Bubble bubble\" was popularized in the hit Disney cartoon DuckTales – \"Much Ado About Scrooge.\" The witches on the island chanted \"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. Leave this island on the double.\" Here, the words from the Macbeth rhyming scheme are reversed. \"Methinks the lady doth protest too much\" Correct quote: \"The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\" – William Shakespeare (Hamlet) This quote comes from Hamlet, Act 3, scene 2, line 254 (line accuracy may differ in varying versions of the play). During the time of Shakespeare, the word \"protest\" meant \"vow\" or \"declare solemnly\" rather than \"deny\". In this manner, Gertrude is making a comment about the Player Queen's overzealous attachment to the Player King rather than a denial of guilt. The quote is Gertrude's response to Hamlet's asking her if she is enjoying the play. \"Money is the root of all evil.\" In context: \"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" (1 Timothy 6:10) KJV (The King James Bible) Many translations render what the KJV renders as \"the root\" (originally ῥίζα) as \"a root\" or \"at the root\" and \"all evil\" (πᾶς κακός) as \"all sorts of evil\" or \"all kinds of evil\". (See also translations in New International Version, New American Standard Bible, New Living Translation.) All translations agree that it is the love of money, rather than money itself, that is associated with evil. \"Now is the winter of our discontent.\" In context: \"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this son of York.\" – William Shakespeare (Richard III) Notes: This is not a misquotation but a selective quotation, because the grammar of the quotation is different from the grammar of the original, and hence the meaning may be lost on some. As misquoted, is is the main verb, and the phrase means, \"The winter of our discontent is happening now.\" In the full quote, is is an auxiliary verb and might be rephrased according to modern usage, to clarify the meaning: \"Now the winter of our discontent is made into a glorious summer by this sun of York.\" (This sun of York and not son, a punning reference to the coat of arms of Edward IV.) \"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him well.\" Correct quote: \"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio – a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.\" – William Shakespeare (Hamlet, Act V, Scene I) \"Play it again, Sam\" Actual quote: \"Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake, play 'As Time Goes By'.\" – Ingrid Bergman (Casablanca) Actual quote: \"You played it for her, you can play it for me. ... If she can stand to listen to it, I can. Play it.\" – Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca) The line first occurred in the Marx Brothers' film A Night in Casablanca (1946), a possible source of the misquotation. \"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille\" Actual quote: \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up\" Gloria Swanson (Sunset Boulevard) \"Greed is good\" Actual quote: \"The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works.\" – Gordon Gekko (Wall Street) \"Someone set us up the bomb\" Correct quote: \"Somebody set up us the bomb\" The spoken words are \"Someone set us up the bomb\" in the flash animation, which made the phenomenon popular. \"somebody set up us the bomb\" is a cheat code in Empire Earth to win the game automatically. Notes: From a Japanese video game, Zero Wing, with a very unskilled and amusing English translation. The original Japanese - nanimonoka niyotte bakuhatsubutsu ga shikakerareta youdesu - is natural and unbroken, although it conveys much greater uncertainty about what has happened. Similar to \"all your base are belong to us\", which occurs in the same game. \"The rest is science\" Correct quote: \"The rest is silence\" – William Shakespeare (Hamlet) Notes: This phrase may also be used as a play on words, or even plain prose, as when Steve Swallow, the jazz musician, said about jazz composition, \"Eventually, an idea always comes, and then the rest is science\". \"To gild the lily\" Correct quote: \"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily\" – William Shakespeare (The Life and Death of King John, Act IV, Scene II, line 13) (Shakespeare was himself playing with the Biblical story that says that one does not need to add to what God has already done for the lily (Matt 6:28) \"See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these\".) \"Why don't you come up and see me sometime?\" Correct quote: \"Why don't you come up sometime and see me? I'm home every evening\". – Mae West (She Done Him Wrong) She switched the word order in her next film, I'm No Angel, where she says, \"Come up and see me sometime\", without the \"Why don't you\". A mechanical mouse in a Tom and Jerry cartoon repeated, \"Come up and see me sometime\". \"I am not a crook\" – Richard Nixon Often attributed to his denial of any foreknowledge of the Watergate break-in, when, in fact, the question raised in a Press Conference was about his personal finances. Nixon's response, properly worded, was: \"And I think, too, that I can say that in my years of public life, that I welcome this kind of examination because people have gotta know whether or not their President's a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got\". \"You dirty rat!\" Never said by James Cagney in any film. However, in Blonde Crazy (1931) he says that another character is a \"dirty, double-crossing rat!\" In Taxi! Taxi!(1932) James Cagney is ready to kill a man who killed his brother, (hence the full misquote in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, \"You dirty rat, you killed my brother\") and says, \"Come out and take it, you dirty yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door!\" This would be the closest true quotation in context and wording. Also quoted in the 1934 Cole Porter musical Anything Goes Also quoted in the 1990 movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles by the character Michelangelo in an attempt to impersonate James Cagney \"The only traditions of the Royal Navy are rum, sodomy and the lash.\" Winston Churchill's personal secretary, Anthony Montague-Browne, said that although Churchill did not say this, he wished he had. \"A language is a dialect with a navy.\" Original (in Yiddish): \"אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמיי און פֿלאָט„ (A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot) – \"A language is a dialect with an army and navy\". This was not said by Otto von Bismarck but rather by the linguist Max Weinreich. \"The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crisis maintain their neutrality\", or a variation on that. This was stated by John F. Kennedy and attributed by him to Dante . However, in the Divine Comedy those who \"non furon ribelli né fur fedeli\" — neither rebelled against nor were faithful to God — are located directly inside the gate of Hell, a region neither hot nor cold (Inferno, canto 3); the lowest part of Hell, a frigid lake of ice, was for traitors. \"A damn close run thing\" – Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington, referring to his victory over Napoleon at Waterloo. He actually said, \"It has been a damn nice thing-the nearest run thing you ever saw...\" with nice in the archaic meaning of \"careful or precise\" and not the modern \"attractive or agreeable\" or the even more archaic meaning of \"foolish\". \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\" – Clint Eastwood as Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry Correct quote plus context: \"Ah-ah. I know what you're thinking: 'Did he fire six shots, or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But, being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, PUNK?\" Jim Carrey's character in The Mask came closer to the correct quote: \"Now you have to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well... do ya... PUNKS?\" \"Whenever I hear the word 'culture' I reach for my revolver.\" The actual quote is \"Wenn ich Kultur höre ... entsichere ich meinen Browning!\" This translates as: \"Whenever I hear [the word] 'culture'... I remove the safety from my Browning!\" This quote is often mistakenly attributed to leading Nazi Hermann Göring, or occasionally to Julius Streicher, a lower-ranking Nazi. This misattribution may date from the famous Frank Capra documentaries (Why We Fight) shown to American troops before shipping out. In fact, it is a line uttered by the character Thiemann in Act 1, Scene 1 of the play Schlageter, written by Hanns Johst. The association with Nazism is appropriate, as the play was first performed in April 1933, in honor of Hitler's birthday. Baldur von Schirach, head of the Hitlerjugend, delivered this sentence in a public speech, circa 1938. A footage of the scene, with von Schirach actually drawing his gun, appears in Frederic Rossif's documentary from Nürnberg to Nürnberg. Notes: It is possible that this is actually a rather more felicitous phrase in translation than it is in the original. Both the original German and this English translation were juxtaposed by Howard Thomas in his review of an article by Nicholas H. Battey in the Journal of Experimental Biology, December 2002, as \"the famous words of Hanns Johst: 'Wenn ich Kultur höre ... entsichere ich meinen Browning' – 'Whenever I hear the word culture, I reach for my revolver.'\" The phrase itself may be a play on words as the word Browning may refer to both a pistol and the English poet Robert Browning. Additionally it should be noted that a Browning (most likely the M1935 High-Power) is not a revolver, but a magazine-fed semi-automatic pistol. However, at the time, the word \"Browning\" was used to refer to any pistol, much as \"Colt\" is used for any revolver in westerns. \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\" The correct quotation is \"Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned/ Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.\" by William Congreve in The Mourning Bride of 1697. \"Don't fire till you see the whites of their eyes.\" This quotation is usually attributed to Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. In fact, it originates with Colonel William Prescott commander of George Washington's Continental Army, at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The full quotation is, \"Don't fire till you see the whites of their eyes. Then, fire low!\" Source: George Washington's War by Robert Leckie \"Houston, we have a problem\" This phrase, supposedly uttered by Apollo 13 commander, Jim Lovell was, in its original rendering: \"Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a main B bus undervolt.\" However, the first notification to Houston that there was a problem was by fellow astronaut Jack Swigert, who used almost identical words. The official NASA chronology lists the messages as:55:55:20 – Swigert: \"Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here.\" 55:55:28 – Lousma: \"This is Houston. Say again please.\" 55:55:35 – Lovell: \"Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a main B bus undervolt.\" However, in the movie Apollo 13, Tom Hanks says Houston, we have a problem,. \"Kismet Hardy / Kiss me, Hardy\" – British Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson Nelson is rumoured to have said \"Kismet Hardy\" or \"Kiss me, Hardy\" whilst he was dying. Kismet means Fate. However, the OED gives the earliest use in the English language of \"kismet\" as 1849. On his deathbed, Nelson said Kiss me, Hardy to his Flag Captain, Thomas Masterman Hardy, but they were not his final words, and Hardy was not present at Nelson's death. Nelson's actual final words (related by HMS Victory's Surgeon William Beatty, who was with him when he died) were \"Thank God, I have done my duty. Drink, drink. Fan, fan. Rub, rub\". \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\" – Edmund Burke Probably a succinct paraphrase of a remark known to have been made by the Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, in an address at the University of St. Andrew (1 February 1867) : Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. Similar in meaning to the following quote in Burke's \"Thoughts on the Cause of Present Discontents\": \"When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\" Also attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville. \"We don't need no steenking badges!\" – Bandit in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre The original quote is \"Badges? We ain't got no badges! We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!\" This quote is actually from the film Blazing Saddles, in an obvious spoof of the original source. When the newly recruited Mexican Bandits are presented badges for their participation in the upcoming raid on the town of Rock Ridge, the leader responds with: \"Badges? We don't need no stinking badges.\" The line was again misquoted in the movie The Ninth Configuration, in which a group of mental patients spend their time playing a game called \"Famous Lines from Famous Movies\" where one person quotes a line and the rest must identify the movie. This is also quoted in the Weird Al Yankovic film UHF, with 'badges' replaced with 'badgers'. A variant of this line is used by the Decepticon, Starscream, in the Transformers episode \"Ghost in the Machine\", in which he says, \"Passes? We don't need to show you no stinking passes!\" \"Spare the rod, spoil the child\" There are numerous proverbs dealing with the subject of discipline in child rearing, but this is the closest: \"He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.\" – Bible (King James Version), Proverbs 13:24 This quote can be found in \"Hudibras\" by Samuel Butler, a poem in the 1600s \"Crisis? What crisis?\" – British Prime Minister James Callaghan This was a headline from The Sun newspaper (11 January 1979) referring to Callaghan's reply at an improvised press conference. Asked \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\", Callaghan replied \"Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.\" \"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\" This quote is often attributed to Sigmund Freud to show that even that a famous psychoanalyst can admit that not everything has a profound meaning; however, no variation of this quote ever appears in his writings. It appears to have been falsely attributed to him several years after his death. An alternative from Rudyard Kipling, from his poem \"The Betrothed\": \"A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke; And a woman is only a woman, but a good Cigar is a Smoke.\" \"Preach the Gospel always, and if necessary, use words.\" Often attributed to Francis of Assisi, the origin of this quote is unknown. \"Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.\" Often attributed to Winston Churchill (). The phrase originated with François Guizot (1787-1874): \"Not to be a republican at twenty is proof of want of heart; to be one at thirty is proof of want of head.\" It was revived by French Premier Georges Clemenceau (1841-1929): \"Not to be a socialist at twenty is proof of want of heart; to be one at thirty is proof of want of head.\" Referenced in Swimming with Sharks (1994) as \"if you're not a rebel by the age of 20, you've got no heart, but if you haven't turned establishment by 30, you've got no brains.\" \"I woke up this mornin' and I got myself a beer.\" Correctly, according to the book Light My Fire by fellow Doors member Ray Manzarek, Jim Morrison was in fact singing \"I woke up this mornin' and I got myself a beard\", as the song allegedly tells of Morrison waking up after 3 weeks of drug-induced sleep. The line \"I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer\" was inspired by Alice Cooper. He and Morrison were talking at the recording studio just before Jim went to record this song. He asked Alice about his day and he responded \"Ehh.. Woke up this morning.... got myself a beer.\" Morrison decided to use the line in the song. Repeated in many interviews with Alice Cooper over the years. \"Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease.\" John Lennon's intended lyric from The Beatles' 1969 song \"Come Together was actually \"Hold you in his arms, yeah, you can feel his disease.\" When informed that most people heard it as \"armchair,\" Lennon stated that that lyric was also acceptable to him. Let them eat cake. This was never said by Marie Antoinette. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his 1783 autobiography Confessions, relates that \"a great princess\" is said to have advised, with regard to starving peasants, \"S'ils n'ont plus de pain, qu'ils mangent de la brioche,\" commonly translated as \"If they have no bread, let them eat cake!\" It has been speculated that he was actually referring to Maria Theresa of Spain. (Rousseau's manuscript was written in 1767, when Marie Antoinette was only 12 and would not marry the future Louis XVI for another three years.) You want the truth? You can't handle the truth! While Jack Nicholson indeed says the second part of this line in the film A Few Good Men, the correct dialogue sequence is: \"You want answers?\" \"I want the truth!\" \"You can't handle the truth!\" Cruise's character, in response to being asked if he wants answers, responds that he thinks he is entitled; asked again if he wants answers, Cruise states that he wants the truth. This sets off the monologue from Nicholson that begins with \"You can't handle the truth!\" This misquotation is commonly used in parodies of the scene, including twice on The Simpsons. Hello, Clarice. This line, while occasionally used in parodies of the film The Silence of the Lambs, was never once used in the film itself. However, Anthony Hopkins's character, Hannibal Lecter, does at one point utter a similar phrase of \"Good evening, Clarice.\" On the other hand in the sequel Hannibal, when the doctor answers Detective Pazzi's cell phone, just before he pushes him off the library balcony, Dr. Lecter greets Agent Starling with the following, \"Is this Clarice? Well, hello Clarice...\" Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten me into Attributed to Oliver Hardy, and often said after another one of Stan Laurel's mistakes. The actual quote was \"Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!\", which was said in the 1930's short The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case, but there were several variations in subsequent films. The short, which followed The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case, was Another Fine Mess, which is presumably the source. Ray Stevens later recorded a song that quoted \"Here's another fine mess you've gotten me into / another fine mess, ah well, what else is new.\" Actually, first written by W. S. Gilbert in the 1885 operetta, \"The Mikado\" (libretto, see act II, 1st dialogue line after the song \"See how the Fates their gifts allot\"). The original line is \"Well, a nice mess you've got us into, ...\" spoken by the character Ko-Ko to Pooh-Bah, in reaction to a lie the two of them, and another character, have told to get out of trouble, but which has resulted in them getting into even more. The ubiquitous popularity of some of Gilbert & Sullivan's works (specifically \"The Mikado\" and \"HMS Pinafore\") has led to any number of phrases from their operettas entering into the common lexicon, frequently no longer recognized as quotes (see this review by H. L. Mencken of the Baltimore Evening Sun, November 29, 1910, or this one, same journalist, same paper, 1911). I'm out of order? You're out of order! This whole court's out of order! Actual quote: \"You're out of order! You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order! They're out of order!\" Character of Arthur Kirkland in ...And Justice for All in response to Judge Rayford saying \"Mr. Kirkland, you are out of order.\" I am the devil, and I have come to do the devil's work. Usually misattributed to Charles Manson, in regard to the murders at the home of Sharon Tate. Manson was not present at any of the murders known to have been committed by his followers. The actual phrase, though not as said above, was uttered by Charles \"Tex\" Watson to Wojciech \"Voytek\" Frykowski. \"I'm the devil, and I'm here to do the devil's work\" is spoken by the character Otis (Bill Moseley) in Rob Zombie's film The Devil's Rejects, most likely as a tribute or homage of some kind to the original quote. Actual quote: \"I'm the devil, I'm here to do the devil's business. Give me all your money.\" Music hath/has charms to soothe the savage beast. A misquotation of William Congreve's play, The Mourning Bride, (1697). Actual quote: \"Musick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast. To soften Rocks, or bend a knotted Oak.\" See Wikipedia listing for William Congreve Only the Dead have seen the end of War. Attributed to Plato, but actually written by George Santayana in his The Life of Reason (1953). It was first misquoted in one of retired general Douglas MacArthur's farewell speeches and then crept into popular use. \"A rose by any other name smells just as sweet.\" Actual quote: \"What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet.\" Act II, scene ii of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet Captain Kirk misquotes the line in the original Star Trek series episode \"By Any Other Name\". Where art thou Romeo? The correct line (with context) is: \"O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?/Deny thy father and refuse thy name./Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,/And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\" Juliet is not asking where Romeo is, she is asking why he is called Romeo. Act II, scene ii of the original Shakespeare Romeo's last name, Montague, means he is supposed to be bitter enemies with Juliet's family, the Capulets and so Juliet is asking him to renounce his name. \"If you build it, they will come\" Actual quote: \"If you build it, he will come\" from Field of Dreams. Possibly a confusion of the Wayne's World 2 quote \"If you book them, they will come.\" Said by the spirit of Jim Morrison. \"'Step into my parlor,' said the spider to the fly.\" Actual quote: \"Will you walk into my parlor?\" said the spider to the fly\" from \"The Spider and the Fly\". Also referenced in the songs \"Spider to the Fly\" by the Paper Chase and \"Lullaby\" by The Cure \"Brain: An apparatus with which we think we think\" Actual quote: \"Brain: An apparatus with which we think that we think\" from Ambrose Bierce's The Devil's Dictionary \"Nul points\" The French phrase is often attributed to the annual Eurovision Song Contest in the media and elsewhere, most notably in the episode of Father Ted, \"Song for Europe\". However, only points from one to twelve (un – douze) are given during the song contest. The phrase refers to the final score after a country has received no votes at all. \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall...\" – The Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs There is no correct source for this quotation, because it originates in a folk tale, and therefore by definition has no author and no known source. The 1937 film has \"Magic mirror on the wall\" (followed by \"who is the fairest one of all?\" and, later in the film, \"who now is the fairest one of all?\"). The Grimms' version of the story has \"Spieglein, Spieglein, an der Wand, Wer ist die Schönste im ganzen Land?\" (literally: \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the most beautiful in the whole country?\") – but of course the Snow White story existed before the Grimms collected it. \"Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, Be him alive or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread.\" Should this be quoting from Joseph Jacobs' English Fairy Tales it should say \"Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum, I smell the blood of Englishman, Be him alive or be he dead, I'll have his bones to grind my bread.\" Luke, I am Your Father – Darth Vader in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back The correct quote is: Darth Vader: Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. Luke Skywalker: He told me enough! He told me you killed him! Darth Vader: No. I am your father. Luke Skywalker: No... that's not true! That's impossible! Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink. A misquotation from the poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1834). Actual quote: Water, water, every where, / And all the boards did shrink; / Water, water, every where, / Nor any drop to drink. \"Brace yourself, winter is coming\" Attributed to Eddard (Ned) Stark (a character from George R. R. Martin's book series 'A Song of Ice and Fire'), but never in the series does he say the two phrases sequentially. \"And I'd have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those meddling kids!\" Commonly attributed to various Scooby-Doo villains after being apprehended and unmasked at the end of the mystery. This quote is a pastiche of the various lines delivered by villains. Some villains would come close to uttering the line but would substitute \"meddlers\" or \"blasted kids\" or some variation. Some villains would use the \"meddling kids\" part but only a part of the rest of the line. Many villains remained silent upon arrest. Frequent use of such a quote first began to appear in A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, where in almost every episode, the villains being arrested would say it, but refer to the gang as \"pesky kids,\" rather than meddling. The \"meddling\" variation did begin to get used (and parodied) frequently in newer productions such as the direct-to-video movies, What's New, Scooby-Doo? and Scooby-Doo, Mystery Incorporated, including commercials such as Direct TV. \"There is no way to happiness; happiness is the way.\" Commonly attributed to Buddha, but not said by him. The source is likely to be either modern Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, or Calvinist clergyman Abraham Johannes Muste. The phrase appears in Thich Nhat Hanh's writings; but it also appears in a volume of US Senate hearings from 1948, when Thich Nhat Hanh had not yet been ordained as a monk. Muste is known to have used a variant of the phrase – \"'peace' is the way\" in 1967, but this was not the first time he had used it, and he had a connection with the 1948 hearing. (Citation is at fakebuddhaquotes.com/there-is-no-path-to-happiness-happiness-is-the-path/) \"Eppur Si Muove (And Yet it Moves).\" While attributed to Galileo during his trial with the Inquisition, there is no actual evidence to support the claim that he actually made this statement. \"Lights, Camera, Action.\" Has never actually been used as a standard cadence in film-making. The call of \"lights\" would refer to burning lights, which had to actually be prepared, and then lit to function, and they would be irrelevant in modern times. There is no evidence that a call of \"camera\" was ever used at all: the call from the camera operator would be \"speed\", indicating that the film in the camera had reached the correct speed for filming. \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\" Said by Neil Armstrong while walking on the moon. Due to static interference during transmission Armstrong's message was misinterpreted and consequently has been misquoted. Armstrong actually said, \"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\" A clip of the landing is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSdHina-fTk. The quote begins at 0:41. There is very obviously no \"a\", and there is no break in the transmission in which it could have occurred unheard. This so-called \"correct\" quote is without question what he intended to say, but not what he said. \"640k ought to be enough for anyone.\" There is no reference to this ever being said by Bill Gates . The earliest reference to Gates saying something like this appeared in the 1985 (not 1981) issue of InfoWorld magazine, and was regretful of the past rather than predictive of the future: \"When we set the upper limit of PC-DOS at 640K, we thought nobody would ever need that much memory.\" Even this was without a precise reference and not part of an interview. The quote bears similarity to one by Bob Newhart: \"Later, I moved up to the 64 KB model (referring to the Commodore 64 personal computer) and thought that was silly because it was more memory than I would ever possibly need.\" \"Do you want to play a game?\" Does not appear in any of the Saw film series. Jigsaw's catchline is \"I want to play a game.\" The question \"Shall we play a game?\" is said by the computer in the movie WarGames. Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the Earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return. This may be the most famous aviation quote that is not verifiable. It is attributed everywhere (including in some Smithsonian publications and the Washington Post) to Leonardo da Vinci. The probable author is John Hermes Secondari (1919-1975), who was a writer for the 1965 TV documentary I, Leonardo da Vinci. There is a more detailed discussion of this on the Leonardo da Vinci \"Talk\" page. Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible. Often attributed to Lord Kelvin, sometimes to Lord Rayleigh or Simon Newcomb. It is a fact that Kelvin did not believe in heavier-than air flight , but there is no reliable source that he or another physicist from 19th century said it was impossible from a scientific point of view. The oldest known source is the book from Chris Morgan Facts and fallacies: a book of definitive mistakes and misguided predictions (1981) Good Morning, Dave. Attributed to HAL 9000 (a character in the movies 2001: A Space Odyssey and 2010) but is never actually spoken by it. Two quotes of HAL 9000 that are very similar to the misquotation are Hello, Dave. in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Good Morning, Dr. Chandra. in 2010. Rivers of Blood. Enoch Powell, the controversial British politician, in the 1960s made a speech referring to the supposed dangers of immigration, which has always been known as the Rivers of Blood speech, but the actual words included \"the River Tiber foaming with blood.\" Are you aware that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as a shameless extrovert? Not only that, but this man is reliably reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, he has a brother who is a known homo sapiens, and he has a sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage, habitually practiced celibacy. Attributed to George Smathers. Smathers never made this speech, nor did he express any such sentiment. The speech, which uses wordplay that would dupe a poorly educated or passive listener into thinking Pepper was part of a family of sexual perverts, was already a sort of urban legend circulating by the time Time magazine first placed it in print in 1950. Don't let it end like this. Tell them I said something. Supposedly the last words of Mexican Revolutionary military leader Pancho Villa following his 1923 assassination. However, most accounts of that event say that he died instantly, without any time to say anything. That's where the money is. Willie Sutton regularly denied, for the rest of his life, having given this answer to a reporter's question about why he robbed banks, and it is believed to have been the reporter's invention. Those denials did not, however, deter Sutton from titling his 1976 autobiography Where the Money Was, which may have led people to believe he did say it. I may be drunk, Bessie, but you are ugly, and tomorrow I shall be sober. There is no record of Churchill making this comeback, often attributed to him, to Bessie Braddock; similar versions of the story involving other public figures of the era circulated before it became attached to him. The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton. While often attributed to the Duke of Wellington on a visit to his alma mater later in life, historians consider it unlikely that he said. It was only first said to have been said by him four decades after the battle, after he had died; in addition he had not spent much time at Eton and did not recall those years fondly. Biographers familiar with his style of speaking also consider it doubtful that, had he expressed a sentiment like that, he would have expressed it that way. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. This quote has been attributed to several sources, including Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Mark Twain. It may have first appeared in Rita Mae Brown's book, Sudden Death, published in January 1983. barrypopik.com psychologytoday.com The people of this country have had enough of experts. - Michael Gove, in interview with Faisal Islam on June 3, 2016. Gove did not end his sentence here; he was interrupted by the interviewer . The full quote is: \"The people of this country have had enough of experts from organizations with acronyms, saying that they know what is best, and getting it consistently wrong.\" By eliding the latter part of the sentence, his opponents could argue that he had referred to experts as a whole, rather than to a particular behavior in which experts engaged. \"Nothing comes between me and my Calvins.\" – Brooke Shields Actual quote: \"Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\" From a television commercial for Calvin Klein Jeans. \"This is not madness. This is Sparta.\" - Gerald Butler as Leonidas in 300 (2007). Actual quote: \"..Madness? This is Sparta.\" The phrase \"This is not madness\" is never spoken in the scene. A misquoted reference to this phrase appeared in the English translation of Phoenix Wright 3: Trials and Tribulations. \"Your princess is in another castle.\" - Super Mario Brothers (1985). Actual quote: \"Thank you, Mario, but our princess is in another castle.\" The quote is spoken by a regular Mushroom citizen who Mario rescues from Bowser's castle in all Worlds prior to World 8, and uses \"our\" because she is the princess of the Mushroom people. The line is not implying Mario's entitled ownership of the princess, nor is it a romantic rejection, and at least in the original game no romance between Mario and the princess is ever implied. \"Your princess is..\" does appear in the much later game Braid (2008) in which the protagonist, Tim, is implied to have an unhealthy and unreciprocated romantic obsession with the princess. \"Imagine, if you will.\" - The Twilight Zone (1959-1964). Host and narrator Rod Serling frequently asked viewers to \"imagine\" when describing the setting for an episode, but he never spoke this exact phrase on the series, though it is often attributed to him. \"The meaning of life is 42.\" - The Hitchhikers’ Guide To The Galaxy. Actual quote: “The answer to the great question, of life, the universe and everything, is 42.” (“The ultimate question” in some versions), spoken by the Magrathean computer Deep Thought. A central point of the plot is that this answer caused the Magratheans to realise that they did not know what the great question was. Versions of the story vary in whether or not they include the question, but in no version is it related to the meaning of life, and in several the Magratheans explicitly state that the answer 42 proves that the question cannot be “why?” or similar. \"What's the deal with [X]?\" - Seinfeld (1989-1998) The semifictional Jerry Seinfeld character occasionally used this phrase, but only with heavy irony so as to mock the concept of observational comedy, and never during the interstitial stand-up segments at the beginning, end, and (early in the series) during episodes. The only non-ironic use of the phrase in the series was spoken by the George Costanza character. \"I don't want to believe, I want to know.\" Quote wrongly attributed to Carl Sagan, who never said or wrote these words. It is not in any of his books, articles and TV shows, nor in any of his interviews. The author of this sentence is Paulo Bittencourt, a freethinker, humanist and atheist, who wrote the books Liberated from Religion and Wasting Time on God. \"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.\" Commonly attributed to Shigeru Miyamoto, there is no proof that he said those exact words or originated the quote. A similar quote appeared in a 1997 edition of the GamePro magazine, but it was referred to as an industry catchphrase Commonly misquoted[edit] People[edit] NOTICE: This section needs additional citations for verification.Please help improve this article by adding reliable references.

Their military value was limited as all large-scale military transportation in Germany was done by train to save fuel. The propaganda ministry turned the construction of the autobahns into a major media event that attracted international attention. propaganda ministry The autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high-speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early 1938. The world record of 432 kilometres per hour (268 mph) set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. In the 1930s, a ten-kilometre stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn 9 just south of Dessau —called the Dessauer Rennstrecke —had bridges with no piers and was designed for cars like the Mercedes-Benz T80 to attempt to make land speed records . The T80 was to make a record attempt in January 1940 , but plans were abandoned after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939.

A protester's sign using the word fuck on Tax March Day, April 15, 2017 in Washington, D.C. U.S. Fuck is an English-language profanity which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain. While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475. In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb. There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker and fuck off. Offensiveness It is unclear whether the word has always been considered a pejorative or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term motherfucker, one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world. Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio. Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that fuck was considered the third-most-severe profanity, and its derivative motherfucker second. Cunt was considered the most severe. Nevertheless, the word has increasingly become less of a pejorative and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\" or semantic drift known as melioration, wherein former pejoratives become inoffensive and commonplace. Because of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's Canadian Press Caps and Spelling guide. Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story. According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers users rather than usage of the word and sub-divides users into \"non-users\", for whom \"the word belongs to a set of taboo words, the very utterance of which constitutes an affront, and any use of the word, regardless of its form (verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) or meaning (literal or metaphorical) evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo.\"; and \"users\", for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word fuck no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\" Etymology Germanic cognates The Oxford English Dictionary states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant 'to have sex'. The word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German ficken ('to fuck'); Dutch fokken ('to breed', 'to beget'); Afrikaans fok ('to fuck'); Icelandic fokka ('to mess around', 'to rush'); dialectal Norwegian fukka ('to copulate'); and dialectal Swedish focka ('to strike', 'to copulate') and fock ('penis'). This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic *fuk(k)ōn-from the verbal root *fug- ('to blow') comes from an Indo-European root *peuk-, or *peuĝ- ('to strike'), cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin pugno ('I fight') or pugnus ('fist'). By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root also has the Pre-Germanic form *pug-néh2- (''to blow'), which is the etymon of, amongst others, Dutch fok(zeil) ('foresail'). There is a theory that fuck is most likely derived from German or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root. False etymologies One reason that the word fuck is difficult to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech, rather than in easily traceable documents or writings. There exist multiple urban legends that advance false etymologies, including the word allegedly being an acronym. One of these urban legends is that the word fuck originated in Irish law. If a couple was caught committing adultery, the two would be punished \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge In the Nude\", with \"FUCKIN\" written on the stocks above to denote the crime. A variant of this legend alleges church clerks to have recorded the crime of \"Forbidden Use of Carnal Knowledge\". Another legend places the origin on a royal permission allegedly granted during the Middle Ages. Due to the Black Death and the consequent scarcity of resources, villages and towns supposedly attempted to control population growth by requiring permission to engage in intercourse. Royal permission (usually from a local magistrate or lord) is said to have required placing a sign visible from the road reading: \"Fornicating/Fornication Under Consent of King\", later shortened to FUCK. This story is not supported by written evidence, and has been proven false, but has persisted in oral and literary traditions for many years. Another legendary etymology, first made popular by the American radio show Car Talk, says that the phrase fuck you derives from pluck yew in connection with a misconception regarding the origins of the V sign. This misconception states that English archers believed that those who were captured by the French had their index and middle fingers cut off so that they could no longer operate their longbows, and that the V sign was used by uncaptured and victorious archers in a display of defiance against the French. The addition of the phrase fuck you to the misconception came when it was claimed that the English yelled that they could still pluck yew, (yew wood being the preferred material for longbows at the time), a phrase that evolved into the modern fuck you. In any event, the word fuck has been in use far too long for some of these supposed origins to be possible. Since no such acronym was ever recorded before the 1960s according to the lexicographical work The F-Word, such claims create at best a so-called \"backronym\". Grammar In terms of its parts of speech, fuck has a very flexible role in English grammar, functioning as both a transitive and intransitive verb, and as an adjective, adverb, noun, and interjection. Fuck and related constructions in the Oxford English Dictionary Although the word itself is used in its literal sense to refer to sexual intercourse, its most common usage is figurative—to indicate the speaker's strong sentiment and to offend or shock the listener. Linguist Geoffrey Hughes found eight distinct usages for English curse words, and fuck can apply to each. For example, it fits in the \"curse\" sense (fuck you!), as well as the \"personal\" sense (You fucker). In the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a hundred different senses, usages and collocations (like fuck around, fuck with s.o., fuck you, fuck me, fuck it) are identified for fuck, its derived forms (like fucker, fuckee, fuckability), and compounds with fuck (e.g. fuckfest, fuckhole, fuckface). Early usage In 2015, Dr. Paul Booth argued he had found \"(possibly) the earliest known use of the word 'fuck' that clearly has a sexual connotation\": in English court records of 1310–11, a man local to Chester is referred to as \"Roger Fuckebythenavele\", probably a nickname. \"Either this refers to an inexperienced copulator, referring to someone trying to have sex with the navel, or it's a rather extravagant explanation for a dimwit, someone so stupid they think that this is the way to have sex\", says Booth. An earlier name, that of John le Fucker recorded in 1278, has been the subject of debate, but is thought by many philologists to have had some separate and non-sexual origin. Otherwise, the usually accepted first known occurrence of the word is found in code in a poem in a mixture of Latin and English composed in the 15th century. The poem, which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge, England, takes its title, \"Flen flyys\", from the first words of its opening line, Flen, flyys, and freris ('Fleas, flies, and friars'). The line that contains fuck reads Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk. Deciphering the phrase gxddbou xxkxzt pg ifmk, here by replacing each letter by the previous letter in alphabetical order, as the English alphabet was then, yields the macaronic non sunt in coeli, quia fuccant vvivys of heli, which translated means, 'They are not in heaven, because they fuck the women of Ely'. The phrase was probably encoded because it accused monks of breaking their vows of celibacy; it is uncertain to what extent the word fuck was considered acceptable at the time. The stem of fuccant is an English word used as Latin. In the Middle English of this poem, the term wife was still used generically for 'woman'.[‡ 1] William Dunbar's 1503 poem \"Brash of Wowing\" includes the lines: \"Yit be his feiris he wald haue fukkit: / Ye brek my hairt, my bony ane\" (ll. 13–14). The oldest known occurrence of the word in adjectival form (which implies use of the verb) in English comes from the margins of a 1528 manuscript copy of Cicero's De Officiis. A monk had scrawled in the margin notes, \"fuckin Abbot\". Whether the monk meant the word literally, to accuse this abbott of \"questionable monastic morals\", or whether he used it \"as an intensifier, to convey his extreme dismay\" is unclear. John Florio's 1598 Italian–English dictionary, A Worlde of Wordes, included the term, along with several now-archaic, but then-vulgar synonyms, in this definition: Fottere: To jape, to sard, to fucke, to swive, to occupy. Of these, \"occupy\" and \"jape\" still survive as verbs, though with less profane meanings, while \"sard\" was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon verb seordan (or seorðan, ON serða), to copulate; and \"swive\" had derived from earlier swīfan, to revolve i.e. to swivel (compare modern-day \"screw\"). As late as the 18th century, the verb occupy was seldom used in print because it carried sexual overtones.[‡ 2] A 1790 poem by St. George Tucker has a father upset with his bookish son say \"I'd not give [a fuck] for all you've read\". Originally printed as \"I'd not give ------ for all you've read\", scholars agree that the words a fuck were removed, making the poem the first recorded instance of the now-common phrase I don't give a fuck. Farmer and Henley's 1893 dictionary of slang notes both the adverbial and adjectival forms of fuck as similar to but \"more violent\" than bloody and indicating extreme insult, respectively. According to an article in the journal Science, research shows that when humans switched to processed foods after the spread of agriculture, they put less wear and tear on their teeth, leading to an overbite in adults. This overbite is said to make it easier to produce \"f\" and \"v\" sounds, and humorously, cleared the way for words like \"Fuck\". Modern usage The modern usage and flexibility of fuck was established by the mid-to-late 19th century, and has been fairly stable since. Most literally, to fuck is to have sex, but it is also used as a more general expletive or intensifier.[‡ 3] Insertion of the trochaic word fucking can also be used as an exercise for diagnosing the cadence of an English-language word. This is the use of fuck or more specifically fucking as an infix, or more properly, a tmesis (see expletive infixation). For example, the word in-fucking-credible sounds acceptable to the English ear, and is in fairly common use, while *incred-fucking-ible would sound very clumsy (though, depending on the context, this might be perceived as a humorous improvisation of the word). Abso-fucking-lutely and motherfucking are also common uses of fuck as an affix. While neither dysphemistic nor connected to the sexual connotations of the word, even the vacuous usages are considered offensive and gratuitous, such as This is fucking awesome![‡ 3] Fuck has colloquial usage as a verb, adverb, adjective, conjunction, interjection, noun, and pronoun. \"WTF?\" spray painted on the rear of a Sherman tank left over from US military shelling practice on Flamenco Beach on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico The word fuck is a component of many acronyms, some of which—like SNAFU (Situation Normal: All Fucked Up) and FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition)—date as far back as World War II. MILF (Mother I'd Like to Fuck) and variations of the first letter are widely seen in pornographic contexts.[‡ 4] Many more recent coinages, such as the shorthand WTF? for 'what the fuck',[‡ 5] STFU for 'shut the fuck up',[‡ 6] or FML for 'fuck my life',[‡ 7] have been widely extant on the Internet, and may count as examples of internet memes. Many acronyms will also have an F or MF added to increase emphasis; for example, OMG ('oh my God') becomes OMFG ('oh my fucking God'). Abbreviations involving fuck can be considered less offensive than fuck itself. Although the word is proclaimed vulgar, several comedians rely on fuck for comedic routines. George Carlin created several literary works based upon the word, including his routine \"seven dirty words\"—words that were bleep censored on US television. \"Fuck all\" is a widely recognised expression meaning \"None, or very little\". Examples of more recent usage In 1928, English writer D. H. Lawrence's novel Lady Chatterley's Lover gained notoriety for its frequent use of the words fuck and fucking. The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger featured the use of fuck you in print. First published in the United States in 1951, the novel remains controversial to this day due in part to its use of the word, standing at number 13 for the most banned books from 1990 to 2000 according to the American Library Association. The first documented use of the word fuck on live British television has been attributed to theatre critic Kenneth Tynan in 1965, though it has been claimed Irish playwright Brendan Behan used the word on Panorama in 1956 or the man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the River Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's teatime magazine programme Roundabout that his job was \"fucking boring\". The Bill Grundy incident was a controversy that ensued in 1976 when Today host Bill Grundy interviewed the Sex Pistols, after guitarist Steve Jones called Grundy a \"dirty fucker\" and a \"fucking rotter\". The word began to break into cinema when it was uttered once in the film Vapor (1963) and in two Andy Warhol films – Poor Little Rich Girl (1965) and My Hustler (1965), and later in each of two 1967 British releases, Ulysses and I'll Never Forget What's'isname. It was used several times in the 1969 British film Bronco Bullfrog. According to director Robert Altman, the first time the word fuck was used in a major American studio film was in 1970's M*A*S*H, spoken by Painless during the football match at the end of the film. Use in politics Antifa rally at Berkeley protests on August 27, 2017 Fuck is not widely used in politics, and the use of the word by politicians often produces controversy. Some events include: In 1965, US President Lyndon B. Johnson said to the Greek ambassador Alexandros Matsas when he objected to American plans in Cyprus, \"Fuck your parliament and your constitution. America is an elephant. Cyprus is a flea. Greece is a flea. If these two fellows continue itching the elephant they may just get whacked by the elephant's trunk, whacked good\". Former British Secretary of State for Defence Denis Healey reported that the penultimate High Commissioner of Aden (1965–1967), Sir Richard Turnbull, stated that, \"When the British Empire finally sinks beneath the waves of history, it will leave behind it only two memorials: one is the game of Association Football and the other is the expression 'Fuck Off'.\" During debate in February 1971 in the House of Commons of Canada, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau mouthed the words \"fuck off\" at Conservative MP John Lundrigan, while Lundrigan made some comments about unemployment. Afterward, when asked by a television reporter what he had been thinking, Trudeau famously replied: \"What is the nature of your thoughts, gentlemen, when you say 'fuddle duddle' or something like that?\". \"Fuddle duddle\" consequently became a catchphrase in Canadian media associated with Trudeau. The first accepted modern use in the British House of Commons came in 1982 when Reg Race, Labour MP for Wood Green, referred to adverts placed in local newsagents by prostitutes which read \"Phone them and fuck them.\" Hansard, the full record of debates, printed \"F*** them\", but even this euphemism was deprecated by the Speaker, George Thomas. During the George W. Bush presidency, a vehicular bumper sticker with the words Buck Fush (a spoonerism of \"Fuck Bush\") gained some popularity in the US. In June 2004, US Vice President Dick Cheney told Democratic senator Patrick Leahy, \"Go fuck yourself.\" Coincidentally, Cheney's outburst occurred on the same day that the Defense of Decency Act was passed in the Senate. In February 2006 Morris Iemma, Premier of the Australian state of New South Wales, while awaiting the start of a Council of Australian Governments media conference in Canberra, was chatting to Victorian Premier Steve Bracks. Not realizing microphones were recording, he said, \"Today? This fuckwit who's the new CEO of the Cross City Tunnel has ... been saying what controversy? There is no controversy.\" The exchange referred to the newly appointed CEO of the recently opened Cross City Tunnel toll road within Sydney. In 2007, U.S. Senator John Cornyn objected to John McCain's perceived intrusion upon a Senate meeting on immigration, saying, \"Wait a second here. I've been sitting in here for all of these negotiations and you just parachute in here on the last day. You're out of line.\" McCain replied \"Fuck you! I know more about this than anyone else in the room.\" In April 2007, New Zealand Education Minister Steve Maharey said \"fuck you\" to a fellow MP during parliamentary question time. He apologized shortly afterwards. In December 2008, recorded telephone conversations revealed Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich trying to \"sell\" an appointment to the Senate seat that Barack Obama resigned after being elected president. In the phone conversation, Blagojevich said in reference to his power to appoint a new senator, \"I've got this thing and it's fucking golden and I'm just not giving it up for fuckin' nothing.\" In the recorded conversations, Blagojevich also referred to Obama as a \"motherfucker\" and repeatedly said, \"fuck him\". When speaking of the Obama administration's request that Valerie Jarrett be appointed as Obama's replacement, Blagojevich complained, \"They're not willing to give me anything except appreciation. Fuck them.\" Blagojevich also said Tribune Company ownership should be told to \"fire those fuckers\" in reference to Chicago Tribune editors critical of him. In December 2009 in Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Irish Parliament), Paul Gogarty responded to heckles from Emmet Stagg with the outburst, \"With all due respect, in the most unparliamentary language, fuck you, Deputy Stagg. Fuck you.\" Gogarty immediately withdrew the remarks and later made a personal statement of apology. Reporting of the outburst quickly spread by media and the Internet. A subcommittee of the Dáil's standing committee on procedure and privilege produced a 28-page report on the incident. On March 23, 2010, US Vice President Joe Biden whispered into President Barack Obama's ear, \"This is a big fucking deal\" when referring to the US health care reform bill. His words were picked up by microphones and video. On May 3, 2010, Canadian senator Nancy Ruth advised representatives of women's groups to \"shut the fuck up\" on access to abortion, in the run-up to the 36th G8 summit. In late 2012, the then-US House Speaker John Boehner was visiting the White House, where he saw then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the lobby. Boehner was under great stress about the impending fiscal cliff, and Reid had also accused him of running a \"dictatorship\" in the house. Boehner saw Harry Reid, pointed his finger at him, and told him, \"Go fuck yourself!\" Reid replied by saying, \"What are you talking about?\" Boehner then repeated what he had told him and left.[better source needed] In late 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte reacted to the European Parliament's criticism over the prevalence of unsolved extrajudicial killings which occurred during his \"War on Drugs\" by lashing out at EU politicians, claiming that they were \"hypocrites\" whose colonial-era ancestors had killed \"thousands\" of Arabs and other peoples during the colonial period. Upon making an obscene hand gesture, Duterte stated that he told EU politicians, \"When I read the EU condemnation I told them 'fuck you.' You are only doing it to atone for your own sins\" and \"They do not want a safe Philippines. They want it to be ruled by criminals. Oh, well, I'm sorry. That is your idiotic view\". Duterte also said, in response to growing international criticism, the \"EU now has the gall to condemn me. I repeat it, fuck you.\" On June 10, 2018, Robert De Niro sparked controversy during the 72nd Tony Awards as he cursed US President Donald Trump with the word during the live broadcast. He started with the sentence: \"I'm gonna say one thing: Fuck Trump.\" He clenched his two fists in the air, and ended his remarks by saying \"It's no longer down with Trump, it's fuck Trump!\" He received a standing ovation from the audience, which was mostly celebrities. On August 5, 2019, Beto O'Rourke after learning of a mass shooting in his home town of El Paso, Texas stated \"He's been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don't know, like, members of the press, what the fuck?\" referring to Donald Trump when asked for his reaction to the shooting. During a virtual live telecast Senate hearing on August 21, 2020, Senator Tom Carper shouted: \"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!\" over a video chat that was being broadcast nationwide. During his October 9, 2020 appearance on The Rush Limbaugh Show, US President Donald Trump stated in a threat to Iran, \"If you fuck around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before.\" In 2021, \"Let's Go Brandon\" became a political slogan and internet meme used as a euphemism for \"Fuck Joe Biden\", the president of the United States. In 2022, President Joe Biden said to the mayor of Fort Myers Beach, Florida, \"No one fucks with a Biden,\" to which Mayor Ray Murphey responded, \"Yeah, you're goddamn right.\" On June 28, 2023, Wisconsin state senator La Tonya Johnson proclaimed mid session on the senate floor, \"Fuck the suburbs, because they don't know a goddamn thing about how life is in the city.\" Use in marketing In April 1997, clothing retailer French Connection began branding their clothes with fcuk (usually written in lowercase), stating it was an acronym for \"French Connection United Kingdom\". Its similarity to the word fuck caused controversy. French Connection produced a range of T-shirts with messages such as \"fcuk this\", \"hot as fcuk\", \"cool as fcuk\", \"fcuk fashion\", etc. In 2009, the European Union's OHIM trade marks agency disallowed a German brewery to market a beer called \"Fucking Hell\". The brewery sued, and on March 26, 2010 got permission to market the beer. The company argued that it was actually named after the Austrian village of Fucking (now spelled Fugging) and the German term for light beer, hell (which is simply the word for \"light-coloured\"). Iancu v. Brunetti is a United States Supreme Court case in which the owner of the clothing brand FUCT (supposedly standing for \"Friends U Can't Trust\") sued the Patent and Trademark Office, which refused to trademark the name for being \"scandalous\" under the Lanham Act. The Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that a provision in 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a) of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as consisting of immoral or scandalous matter, was an unconstitutional restriction of applicants' freedom of speech. Band names The word fuck has been used in a number of band names, such as Fucked Up, generally based on common compounds. Many of these bands fall into the genres of punk and metal, while some fall into the categories of electronic rock and pop, such as Holy Fuck and Fuck Buttons F-bomb The phrase dropping an F-bomb usually refers to the unanticipated use of the word fuck in an unexpected setting, such as public media, a play on the nickname for the hydrogen bomb (the \"H-bomb\")[‡ 8] and the shock value that using the word fuck in discourse carries. The term was first reported in a newspaper (Newsday) in 1988 when Hall of Fame baseball catcher Gary Carter used it. In 2012 it was listed, for the first time, in the mainstream Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. Censorship In the United States, the word is frequently edited out of music and films when broadcast on TV, such as in the film The Big Lebowski, when John Goodman's character repeatedly yells, \"This is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass\". It was censored on television as \"This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps.\" Still, in 1971, the US Supreme Court decided that the public display of fuck is protected under the First and Fourteenth amendments and cannot be made a criminal offense. In 1968, Paul Robert Cohen had been convicted of disturbing the peace for wearing a jacket with the slogan \"Fuck the Draft\" (in a reference to conscription in the Vietnam War). The conviction was upheld by the court of appeals and overturned by the Supreme Court in Cohen v. California. Common alternatives Main article: Minced oath In conversation or writing, reference to or use of the word fuck may be replaced by any of many alternative words or phrases, including the F-word or the F-bomb (a play on A-bomb and H-bomb), or simply, eff or f (as in What the eff/F or You effing/f'ing fool). Also, there are many commonly used substitutes, such as flipping, frigging, fricking, freaking, feck, fudge, flaming, forget or any of a number of similar-sounding nonsense words. In print, there are alternatives such as, F***, F––k, etc.; or a string of non-alphanumeric characters, for example, @$#*%! and similar (especially favored in comic books). A replacement word that was used mainly on Usenet newsgroups is fsck, derived from the name of the Unix file system checking utility.

                        "There is a theory that fuck is most likely derived from German or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root",
                        "Paul Booth argued he had found \"(possibly) the earliest known use of the word 'fuck' that clearly has a sexual connotation\": in English court records of 1310–11, a man local to Chester is referred to as \"Roger Fuckebythenavele\", probably a nickname",
                        "In any event, the word fuck has been in use far too long for some of these supposed origins to be possible",
                        "The first documented use of the word fuck on live British television has been attributed to theatre critic Kenneth Tynan in 1965, though it has been claimed Irish playwright Brendan Behan used the word on Panorama in 1956 or the man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the River Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's teatime magazine programme Roundabout that his job was \"fucking boring\"",
                        "According to director Robert Altman, the first time the word fuck was used in a major American studio film was in 1970's M*A*S*H, spoken by Painless during the football match at the end of the film",
                        "One of these urban legends is that the word fuck originated in Irish law",
                        "According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers users rather than usage of the word and sub-divides users into \"non-users\", for whom \"the word belongs to a set of taboo words, the very utterance of which constitutes an affront, and any use of the word, regardless of its form (verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) or meaning (literal or metaphorical) evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo.\"; and \"users\", for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word fuck no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\" Etymology Germanic cognates The Oxford English Dictionary states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant 'to have sex'",
                        "Paul Booth: \"The significance is the occurrence of (possibly) the earliest known use of the word 'fuck' that clearly has a sexual connotation.\" ^ Wordsworth, Dot (September 26, 2015)",
                        "\"The remarkable discovery of Roger Fuckebythenavele: An exciting discovery in the records of the County Court of Chester – but it's probably not the oldest F-word\"",
                        "This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic *fuk(k)ōn-from the verbal root *fug- ('to blow') comes from an Indo-European root *peuk-, or *peuĝ- ('to strike'), cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin pugno ('I fight') or pugnus ('fist')"

If I had to fall I wish it had been on the sidewalks of New York, not the sidewalks of New Brunswick, N.J. — Alfred E. Smith to Lew Dockstader in December 1923 on Dockstader's fall at what is now the State Theater. New Brunswick is a city in and the seat of government of Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A regional commercial hub for central New Jersey, the city is both a college town (the home of Rutgers University, the state's largest university) and a commuter town for residents commuting to New York City within the New York metropolitan area. New Brunswick is on the Northeast Corridor rail line, 27 miles (43 km) southwest of Manhattan. The city is located on the southern banks of the Raritan River in the heart of the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 55,266, an increase of 85 (+0.2%) from the 2010 census count of 55,181, which in turn reflected an increase of 6,608 (+13.6%) from the 48,573 counted in the 2000 census. The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 55,846 for 2023, making it the 719th-most populous municipality in the nation. Due to the concentration of medical facilities in the area, including Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and medical school, and Saint Peter's University Hospital, New Brunswick is known as both the Hub City and the Healthcare City. The corporate headquarters and production facilities of several global pharmaceutical companies are situated in the city, including Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb. New Brunswick has evolved into a major center for the sciences, arts, and cultural activities. Downtown New Brunswick is developing a growing skyline, filling in with new high-rise towers. New Brunswick is noted for its ethnic diversity. At one time, one-quarter of the Hungarian population of New Jersey resided in the city, and in the 1930s one out of three city residents was Hungarian. The Hungarian community continues as a cohesive community, with the 3,200 Hungarian residents accounting for 8% of the population of New Brunswick in 1992. Growing Asian and Hispanic communities have developed around French Street near Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. History[edit] Etymology[edit] The area around present-day New Brunswick was first inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans, whose Minisink Trail intersected the Raritan River and followed a route that would be taken by later colonial roads. The first European settlement at the site of New Brunswick was made in 1681. The settlement here was called Prigmore's Swamp (1681–1697), then known as Inian's Ferry (1691–1714). In 1714, the settlement was given the name New Brunswick, after the city of Braunschweig (Brunswick in Low German), in the state of Lower Saxony, now located in Germany. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League and was an administrative seat for the Duchy of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Elector of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain. Alternatively, the city gets its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Colonial and Early American periods[edit] Centrally located between New York City and Philadelphia along an early thoroughfare known as the King's Highway and situated along the Raritan River, New Brunswick became an important hub for Colonial travelers and traders. New Brunswick was incorporated as a town in 1736 and chartered as a city in 1784. It was incorporated into a town in 1798 as part of the Township Act of 1798. It was occupied by the British in the winter of 1776–1777 during the Revolutionary War. The Declaration of Independence received one of its first public readings, by Colonel John Neilson in New Brunswick on July 9, 1776, in the days following its promulgation by the Continental Congress. A bronze statue marking the event was dedicated on July 9, 2017, in Monument Square, in front of the Heldrich Hotel. The Trustees of Queen's College (now Rutgers University), founded in 1766, voted by a margin of ten to seven in 1771 to locate the young college in New Brunswick, selecting the city over Hackensack, in Bergen County, New Jersey. Classes began in 1771 with one instructor, one sophomore, Matthew Leydt, and several freshmen at a tavern called the 'Sign of the Red Lion' on the corner of Albany and Neilson Streets (now the grounds of the Johnson & Johnson corporate headquarters); Leydt would become the university's first graduate in 1774 when he was the only member of the graduating class. The Sign of the Red Lion was purchased on behalf of Queens College in 1771, and later sold to the estate of Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh in 1791. Classes were held through the American Revolution in various taverns and boarding houses, and at a building known as College Hall on George Street, until Old Queens was completed and opened in 1811. It remains the oldest building on the Rutgers University campus. The Queen's College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School) was established also in 1766, and shared facilities with the college until 1830, when it located in a building (now known as Alexander Johnston Hall) across College Avenue from Old Queens. After Rutgers University became the state university of New Jersey in 1945, the Trustees of Rutgers divested itself of Rutgers Preparatory School, which relocated in 1957 to an estate purchased from Colgate-Palmolive in Franklin Township in neighboring Somerset County. The New Brunswick Theological Seminary, founded in 1784 in New York, moved to New Brunswick in 1810, sharing its quarters with the fledgling Queen's College. (Queen's closed from 1810 to 1825 due to financial problems, and reopened in 1825 as Rutgers College.) The Seminary, due to overcrowding and differences over the mission of Rutgers College as a secular institution, moved to a tract of land covering 7 acres (2.8 ha) located less than 1⁄2 mile (0.80 km) to the west, which it still occupies, although the land is now in the middle of Rutgers University's College Avenue Campus. New Brunswick was formed by royal charter on December 30, 1730, within other townships in Middlesex and Somerset counties and was reformed by royal charter with the same boundaries on February 12, 1763, at which time it was divided into north and south wards. New Brunswick was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 1, 1784.

Local slaveholders routinely bought and sold African American children, women, and men in New Brunswick in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century. In this period, the Market-House was the center of commercial life in the city. It was located at the corner of Hiram Street and Queen Street (now Neilson Street) adjacent to the Raritan Wharf. The site was a place where residents of New Brunswick sold and traded their goods which made it an integral part of the city's economy. The Market-House also served as a site for regular slave auctions and sales.: 101 By the late-eighteenth century, New Brunswick became a hub for newspaper production and distribution. The Fredonian, a popular newspaper, was located less than a block away from the aforementioned Market-House and helped facilitate commercial transactions. A prominent part of the local newspapers were sections dedicated to private owners who would advertise their slaves for sale. The trend of advertising slave sales in newspapers shows that the New Brunswick residents typically preferred selling and buying slaves privately and individually rather than in large groups.: 103 The majority of individual advertisements were for female slaves, and their average age at the time of the sale was 20 years old, which was considered the prime age for childbearing. Slave owners would get the most profit from the women who fit into this category because these women had the potential to reproduce another generation of enslaved workers. Additionally, in the urban environment of New Brunswick, there was a high demand for domestic labor, and female workers were preferred for cooking and housework tasks.: 107 The New Jersey Legislature passed An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1804. Under the provisions of this law, children born to enslaved women after July 4, 1804, would serve their master for a term of 21 years (for girls) or a term of 25 years (for boys), and after this term, they would gain their freedom. However, all individuals who were enslaved before July 4, 1804, would continue to be slaves for life and would never attain freedom under this law. New Brunswick continued to be home to enslaved African Americans alongside a growing community of free people of color. The 1810 United States Census listed 53 free Blacks and 164 slaves in New Brunswick. African American spaces and institutions in the early 19th century[edit] By the 1810s, some free African Americans lived in a section of the city called Halfpenny Town, which was located along the Raritan River by the east side of the city, near Queen (now Neilson) Street. Halfpenny Town was a place populated by free blacks as well as poorer whites who did not own slaves. This place was known as a social gathering for free blacks that was not completely influenced by white scrutiny and allowed free blacks to socialize among themselves. This does not mean that it was free from white eyes and was still under the negative effects of the slavery era.: 99 In the early decades of the nineteenth century, White and either free or enslaved African Americans shared many of the same spaces in New Brunswick, particularly places of worship. The First Presbyterian Church, Christ Church, and First Reformed Church were popular among both Whites and Blacks, and New Brunswick was notable for its lack of spaces where African Americans could congregate exclusively. Most of the time Black congregants of these churches were under the surveillance of Whites.: 113 That was the case until the creation of the African Association of New Brunswick in 1817.: 114–115 Both free and enslaved African Americans were active in the establishment of the African Association of New Brunswick, whose meetings were first held in 1817.: 112 The African Association of New Brunswick held a meeting every month, mostly in the homes of free blacks. Sometimes these meetings were held at the First Presbyterian Church. Originally intended to provide financial support for the African School of New Brunswick, the African Association grew into a space where blacks could congregate and share ideas on a variety of topics such as religion, abolition and colonization. Slaves were required to obtain a pass from their owner in order to attend these meetings. The African Association worked closely with Whites and was generally favored amongst White residents who believed it would bring more racial peace and harmony to New Brunswick.: 114–115 The African Association of New Brunswick established the African School in 1822. The African School was first hosted in the home of Caesar Rappleyea in 1823.: 114 The school was located on the upper end of Church Street in the downtown area of New Brunswick about two blocks away from the jail that held escaped slaves. Both free and enslaved Blacks were welcome to be members of the School.: 116 Reverend Huntington (pastor of the First Presbyterian Church) and several other prominent Whites were trustees of the African Association of New Brunswick. These trustees supported the Association which made some slave owners feel safe sending their slaves there by using a permission slip process.: 115 The main belief of these White supporters was that Blacks were still unfit for American citizenship and residence, and some trustees were connected with the American Colonization Society that advocated for the migration of free African Americans to Africa. The White trustees only attended some of the meetings of the African Association, and the Association was still unprecedented as a space for both enslaved and free Blacks to get together while under minimal supervision by Whites.: 116–117 The African Association appears to have disbanded after 1824. By 1827, free and enslaved Black people in the city, including Joseph and Jane Hoagland, came together to establish the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church and purchased a plot of land on Division Street for the purpose of erecting a church building. This was the first African American church in Middlesex County. The church had approximately 30 members in its early years. The church is still in operation and is currently located at 39 Hildebrand Way. The street Hildebrand Way is named after the late Rev. Henry Alphonso Hildebrand, who was pastor of Mount Zion AME for 37 years, which is the longest appointment received by a pastor at Mount Zion AME. Records from the April 1828 census, conducted by the New Brunswick Common Council, state that New Brunswick was populated with 4,435 white residents and 374 free African Americans. The enslaved population of New Brunswick in 1828 consisted of 57 slaves who must serve for life and 127 slaves eligible for emancipation at age 21 or 25 due to the 1804 Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery. Free and enslaved African Americans accounted for 11% of New Brunswick's population in 1828, a relatively high percentage for New Jersey.: 94 By comparison, as of the 1830 United States Census, African Americans made up approximately 6.4% of the total population of New Jersey. Jail and curfew in the 19th century[edit] In 1824, the New Brunswick Common Council adopted a curfew for free people of color. Free African Americans were not allowed to be out after 10 pm on Saturday night. The Common Council also appointed a committee of white residents who were charged with rounding up and detaining free African Americans who appeared to be out of place according to white authorities.: 98 New Brunswick became a notorious city for slave hunters, who sought to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Strategically located on the Raritan River, the city was also a vital hub for New Jersey's Underground Railroad. For runaway slaves in New Jersey, it served as a favorable route for those heading to New York and Canada. When African Americans tried to escape either to or from New Brunswick, they had a high likelihood of getting discovered and captured and sent to New Brunswick's jail, which was located on Prince Street, which by now is renamed Bayard Street.: 96 Hungarian community[edit] The Committee of Hungarian Churches and Organizations of New Brunswick commemorating the anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 New Brunswick has been described as the nation's \"most Hungarian city\", with Hungarian immigrants arriving in the city as early as 1888 and accounting for almost 20% of the city's population in 1915. Hungarians were primarily attracted to the city by employment at Johnson & Johnson factories located in the city. Hungarians settled mainly in what today is the Fifth Ward and businesses were established to serve the needs of the Hungarian community that weren't being met by mainstream businesses. The immigrant population grew until the end of the immigration boom in the early 20th century. During the Cold War, the community was revitalized by the decision to process the tens of thousands refugees who came to the United States from the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution at Camp Kilmer, in nearby Edison. Even though the Hungarian population has been largely supplanted by newer immigrants, there continues to be a Hungarian Festival in the city held on Somerset Street on the first Saturday of June each year; the 44th annual event was held in 2019. Many Hungarian institutions set up by the community remain and are active in the neighborhood, including: Magyar Reformed Church, Ascension Lutheran Church, St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Church, St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church, Hungarian American Athletic Club, Aprokfalva Montessori Preschool, Széchenyi Hungarian Community School & Kindergarten, Teleki Pál Scout Home, Hungarian American Foundation, Vers Hangja, Hungarian Poetry Group, Bolyai Lecture Series on Arts and Sciences, Hungarian Alumni Association, Hungarian Radio Program, Hungarian Civic Association, Committee of Hungarian Churches and Organizations of New Brunswick, and Csűrdöngölő Folk Dance Ensemble. Several landmarks in the city also testify to its Hungarian heritage. There is a street and a park named after Lajos Kossuth, one of the leaders of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The corner of Somerset Street and Plum Street is named Mindszenty Square where the first ever statue of Cardinal József Mindszenty was erected. A stone memorial to the victims of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution stands nearby. Latino community[edit] In the 2010 Census, about 50% of New Brunswick's population is self-identified as Hispanic, the 14th highest percentage among municipalities in New Jersey. Since the 1960s, many of the new residents of New Brunswick have come from Latin America. Many citizens moved from Puerto Rico in the 1970s. In the 1980s, many immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and still later from Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Mexico. Demolition, revitalization, and redevelopment[edit] The Gateway Project under construction College Avenue, a juxtaposition of old and new structures New Brunswick is one of nine cities in New Jersey designated as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state's Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within a half-mile of a train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit. New Brunswick contains a number of examples of urban renewal in the United States. In the 1960s–1970s, the downtown area became blighted as middle class residents moved to newer suburbs surrounding the city, an example of the phenomenon known as \"white flight.\" Beginning in 1975, Rutgers University, Johnson & Johnson and the city's government collaborated through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to form the New Brunswick Development Company (DevCo), with the goal of revitalizing the city center and redeveloping neighborhoods considered to be blighted and dangerous (via demolition of existing buildings and construction of new ones). Johnson & Johnson announced in 1978 that they would remain in New Brunswick and invest $50 million to build a new world headquarters building in the area between Albany Street, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, Route 18, and George Street, requiring many old buildings and historic roads to be removed. The Hiram Market area, a historic district that by the 1970s had become a mostly Puerto Rican and Dominican-American neighborhood, was demolished to build a Hyatt hotel and conference center, and upscale housing. Johnson & Johnson guaranteed the investment made by Hyatt Hotels, as they were wary of building an upscale hotel in a run-down area.[citation needed] Devco, the hospitals, and the city government have drawn ire from both historic preservationists, those opposing gentrification and those concerned with eminent domain abuses and tax abatements for developers. New Brunswick is home to the main campus of Rutgers University and Johnson & Johnson, which in 1983 constructed its new headquarters in the city. Both work with Devco in a public–private partnership to redevelop downtown, particularly regarding transit-oriented development. Boraie Development, a real estate development firm based in New Brunswick, has developed projects using the incentives provided by Devco and the state.[citation needed] First Reformed Church, built in 1812, long the tallest building in the city National Bank of New Jersey, 1908 Tallest buildings[edit] Christ Church, originally built in 1742, was the tallest building at the time of construction. A steeple was added in 1773 and replaced in 1803. The six-story First Reformed Church, built in 1812 was long the city's tallest structure. One of the earliest tall commercial buildings in the city was the eight-story 112.5 ft (34.29 m) National Bank of New Jersey built in 1908. The 4 nine-story 125 ft (38 m) buildings of the New Brunswick Homes housing project, originally built in 1958, were demolished by implosion in 2000 and largely replaced by low-rise housing. While there are no buildings over 300 feet (91 meters) in the city, since the beginning of the new millennium, a number of high-rise residential buildings clustered around the New Brunswick station have joined those built in the 1960s on the city's skyline. Since the advent of the 21st century, New Brunswick has rapidly developed high-rise skyline. In 2008, there was a proposal to construct a 34-story 466-foot (142 m) New Brunswick Cultural Center Tower, which would have been the city's tallest building. In 2017 it was announced that the New Brunswick Performing Arts Center would be built on the site of the George Street Playhouse and Crossroads Theatre and would include 25 stories of residential and office space. The HELIX Health + Life Science Exchange is planned to contain three buildings: H-1,H-2, and H-3, the last of which will become the city's tallest building, with 42 stories. The Standard 249 ft (76 m) at 22 stories was approved in 2014. The Rutgers Cancer Center is a proposed 12 story building.

New Brunswick is on the south side of Raritan Valley along with Piscataway, Highland Park, Edison, and Franklin Township. New Brunswick lies southwest of Newark and New York City and northeast of Trenton and Philadelphia. New Brunswick is bordered by the municipalities of Piscataway, Highland Park and Edison across the Raritan River to the north by way of the Donald and Morris Goodkind Bridges, and also by North Brunswick to the southwest, East Brunswick to the southeast, all in Middlesex County; and by Franklin Township in Somerset County. While the city does not hold elections based on a ward system it has been so divided. There are several neighborhoods in the city, which include the Fifth Ward, Feaster Park, Lincoln Park,[citation needed] Raritan Gardens, and Edgebrook-Westons Mills. Climate[edit] Under the Köppen climate classification, New Brunswick falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used.

The predominant language is Standard Chinese, which is based on Beijingese, but there are hundreds of related Chinese languages, collectively known as Hanyu (simplified Chinese: 汉语; traditional Chinese: 漢語; pinyin: Hànyǔ, 'Han language'), that are spoken by 92% of the population. The Chinese (or 'Sinitic') languages are typically divided into seven major language groups, and their study is a distinct academic discipline. They differ as much from each other morphologically and phonetically as do English, German and Danish, but meanwhile share the same writing system (Hanzi) and are mutually intelligible in written form. There are in addition approximately 300 minority languages spoken by the remaining 8% of the population of China. The ones with greatest state support are Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang. According to the 2010 edition of Nationalencyklopedin, 955 million out of China's then-population of 1.34 billion spoke some variety of Mandarin Chinese as their first language, accounting for 71% of the country's population. According to the 2019 edition of Ethnologue, 904 million people in China spoke some variety of Mandarin as their first language in 2017. Standard Chinese, known in China as Putonghua, based on the Mandarin dialect of Beijing, is the official national spoken language for the mainland and serves as a lingua franca within the Mandarin-speaking regions (and, to a lesser extent, across the other regions of mainland China). Several other autonomous regions have additional official languages. For example, Tibetan has official status within the Tibet Autonomous Region and Mongolian has official status within Inner Mongolia. Language laws of China do not apply to either Hong Kong or Macau, which have different official languages (Cantonese, English and Portuguese) from the mainland. Spoken languages[edit] The spoken languages of nationalities that are a part of China belong to at least nine families: Ethnolinguistic map of China The Sino-Tibetan family: 19 official ethnicities (including the Han and Tibetans) The Tai–Kadai family: several languages spoken by the Zhuang, the Bouyei, the Dai, the Dong, and the Hlai (Li people); 9 official ethnicities. The Hmong–Mien family: 3 official ethnicities The Austroasiatic family: 4 official ethnicities (De'ang, Blang, Gin (Vietnamese), and Wa) The Turkic family: Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Salars, etc.; 7 official ethnicities. The Mongolic family: Mongols, Dongxiang, and related groups; 6 official ethnicities. The Tungusic family: Manchus (formerly), Hezhe, etc.; 5 official ethnicities. The Koreanic family: Korean The Indo-European family: 2 official ethnicities, the Russians and Tajiks (actually Pamiri people).

The work contains four terms on each of its pages, arranged in the order of Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian, Chagatai, and Chinese languages. For the Tibetan, it includes both transliteration and a transcription into the Manchu alphabet. For the Chagatai, it includes a line of transcription into the Manchu alphabet. The following languages traditionally had written forms that do not involve Chinese characters (hanzi): The Dai people Tai Lü language – Tai Lü alphabet Tai Nüa language – Tai Nüa alphabet The Daur people – Daur language – Manchu alphabet The Hmong people – Hmongic languages – Hmong writing(Pollard script, Pahawh Hmong, Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, etc.) The Kazakhs – Kazakh language – Kazakh alphabets The Koreans – Korean language – Chosŏn'gŭl alphabet The Kyrgyz – Kyrgyz language – Kyrgyz alphabets The Lisu people – Lisu language – Lisu script The Manchus – Manchu language – Manchu alphabet The Mongols – Mongolian language – Mongolian alphabet The Naxi – Naxi language – Dongba characters The Qiang people – Qiang language or Rrmea language – Rma script The Santa people (Dongxiangs in Chinese) – Santa language – Arabic script The Sui – Sui language – Sui script The Tibetans – Tibetan language – Tibetan alphabet The Uyghurs – Uyghur language – Uyghur Arabic alphabet The Xibe – Xibe language – Manchu alphabet The Yi – Yi language – Yi syllabary Many modern forms of spoken Chinese languages have their own distinct writing system using Chinese characters that contain colloquial variants. These typically are used as sound characters to help determine the pronunciation of the sentence within that language: Written Sichuanese – Sichuanese Written Cantonese – Cantonese Written Shanghainese – Shanghainese Written Hakka – Hakka Written Hokkien – Hokkien Written Teochew – Teochew Some non-Sinitic peoples have historically used Chinese characters: The Koreans – Korean language – Hanja The Vietnamese – Vietnamese language – Chữ nôm The Zhuang (Tai people) – Zhuang languages – Sawndip The Bouyei people – Bouyei language – Bouyei writing(方塊布依字) The Bai people – Bai language – Bai writing(僰文) The Dong people – Dong language (China) – Dong writing(方塊侗字) Other languages, all now extinct, used separate logographic scripts influenced by, but not directly derived from, Chinese characters: The Jurchens (Manchu ancestors) – Jurchen language – Jurchen script The Khitans (Mongolic people) – Khitan language – Khitan large and small scripts The Tanguts (Sino-Tibetan people) – Tangut language – Tangut script During Qing dynasty, palaces, temples, and coins have sometimes been inscribed in five scripts: Chinese Manchu Mongol Tibetan Chagatai During the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the official writing system was: 'Phags-pa script The reverse of a one jiao note with Chinese (Pinyin) at the top and Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Zhuang along the bottom. Chinese banknotes contain several scripts in addition to Chinese script. These are: Mongol Tibetan Arabic (for Uyghur) Latin (for Zhuang) Other writing system for Chinese languages in China include: Nüshu script Ten nationalities who never had a written system have, under the PRC's encouragement, developed phonetic alphabets. According to a government white paper published in early 2005, \"by the end of 2003, 22 ethnic minorities in China used 28 written languages.\" Language policy[edit] One decade before the demise of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Mandarin was promoted in the planning for China's first public school system. Mandarin has been promoted as the commonly spoken language for the country since 1956, based phonologically on the dialect of Beijing. The North Chinese language group is set up as the standard grammatically and lexically. Meanwhile, Mao Zedong and Lu Xun writings are used as the basis of the stylistic standard. Pronunciation is taught with the use of the romanized phonetic system known as pinyin. Pinyin has been criticized for fear of an eventual replacement of the traditional character orthography. The Chinese language policy in mainland China is heavily influenced by the Soviet nationalities policy and officially encourages the development of standard spoken and written languages for each of the nationalities of China. Language is one of the features used for ethnic identification. In September 1951, the All-China Minorities Education Conference established that all minorities should be taught in their language at the primary and secondary levels when they count with a writing language. Those without a writing language or with an \"imperfect\" writing language should be helped to develop and reform their writing languages. However, in this schema, Han Chinese are considered a single nationality and the official policy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) treats the different varieties of Chinese differently from the different national languages, even though their differences are as significant, if not more so, as those between the various Romance languages of Europe. While official policies in mainland China encourage the development and use of different orthographies for the national languages and their use in educational and academic settings, realistically speaking it would seem that, as elsewhere in the world, the outlook for minority languages perceived as inferior is grim. The Tibetan Government-in-Exile argue that social pressures and political efforts result in a policy of sinicization and feels that Beijing should promote the Tibetan language more. Because many languages exist in China, they also have problems regarding diglossia. Recently, in terms of Fishman's typology of the relationships between bilingualism and diglossia and his taxonomy of diglossia (Fishman 1978, 1980) in China: more and more minority communities have been evolving from \"diglossia without bilingualism\" to \"bilingualism without diglossia.\" This could be an implication of mainland China's power expanding. In 2010, Tibetan students protested against changes in the Language Policy on the schools that promoted the use of Mandarin Chinese instead of Tibetan. They argued that the measure would erode their culture. In 2013, China's Education Ministry said that about 400 million people were unable to speak the national language Mandarin. In that year, the government pushed linguistic unity in China, focusing on the countryside and areas with ethnic minorities. See also: 2020 Inner Mongolia protests Mandarin Chinese is the prestige language in practice, and failure to protect ethnic languages does occur. In summer 2020, the Inner Mongolian government announced an education policy change to phase out Mongolian as the language of instructions for humanities in elementary and middle schools, adopting the national instruction material instead. Thousands of ethnic Mongolians in northern China gathered to protest the policy. The Ministry of Education describes the move as a natural extension of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language (Chinese: 通用语言文字法) of 2000. Study of foreign languages[edit] English has been the most widely-taught foreign language in China, as it is a required subject for students attending university. Other languages that have gained some degree of prevalence or interest are Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. During the 1950s and 1960s, Russian had some social status among elites in mainland China as the international language of socialism. In the late 1960s, English replaced the position of Russian to become the most studied foreign language in China.[citation needed] After the Reform and Opening-up policy in 1988, English was taught in public schools starting in the third year of primary school. Russian, French, and German language classes have been made widely available in universities and colleges. In Northeast China, there are many bilingual schools (Mandarin-Japanese; Mandarin-Korean; Mandarin-Russian), in these schools, students learn languages other than English. The Economist reported in 2006 that up to one fifth of the population was learning English. Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister, estimated that the total English-speaking population in China would outnumber the native speakers in the rest of the world in two decades. There have been a growing number of students studying Arabic, due to reasons of cultural interest and belief in better job opportunities. The language is also widely studied amongst the Hui people. In the past, literary Arabic education was promoted in Islamic schools by the Kuomintang when it ruled mainland China. There have also been a growing number of students choosing to learn Urdu, due to interest in Pakistani culture, close ties between the respective nations, and job opportunities provided by the CPEC. Interest in Portuguese and Spanish have increased greatly, due in part to Chinese investment in Latin America as well as in African nations such as Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde. Portuguese is also one of the official languages in Macau, although its use had stagnated since the nation's transfer from Portugal to the PRC. It was estimated in 2016 that 2.3% of Macau's locals spoke the language, although with government backing since then, interest in it has increased. Esperanto became prominent in certain circles in the early 20th century and reached its peak in the 1980s, though by 2024 its prominence had declined. Use of English[edit] In China, English is used as a lingua franca in several fields, especially for business settings, and in schools to teach Standard Mandarin to people who are not Chinese citizens. English is also one of the official languages in Hong Kong.

Purring is believed to indicate a positive emotional state , but cats sometimes purr when they are ill, tense, or experiencing traumatic or painful moments such as giving birth. It has also been suggested that purring can act as a soothing mechanism and promote healing after injury. felines positive emotional state Scientists from the University of Vienna researching cat vocalizations found that the larynxes made a purring sound when air was passed through them, meaning that muscle contraction is not required. Instead, the sounds were made possible by connective tissue embedded in the vocal folds that lowered the frequency of the sounds they produced. When an animal purrs, its vocal cords vibrate at a low frequency, which creates a distinctive rumbling sound produced with harmonics . One hypothesis, supported by electromyographic studies is that cats produce the purring noise by using the vocal folds and/or the muscles of the larynx to alternately dilate and constrict the glottis rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation. vocal cords harmonics electromyographic vocal folds larynx glottis Purring is sometimes accompanied by other sounds, though this varies between individual cats. Some may only purr, while others emit low-level outbursts, sometimes called \"lurps\" or \"yowps\". It was once believed that only the cats of the genus Felis could purr.

It is a product of the Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other multilateral organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels. One major objective of the Agenda 21 initiative is that every local government should draw its own local Agenda 21. Its aim initially was to achieve global sustainable development by 2000, with the \"21\" in Agenda 21 referring to the original target of the 21st century. Structure[edit] Agenda 21 is grouped into 4 sections: Section I: Social and Economic Dimensions is directed toward combating poverty, especially in developing countries, changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making. Section II: Conservation and Management of Resources for Development includes atmospheric protection, combating deforestation, protecting fragile environments, conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity), control of pollution and the management of biotechnology, and radioactive wastes. Section III: Strengthening the Role of Major Groups includes the roles of children and youth, women, NGOs, local authorities, business and industry, and workers; and strengthening the role of indigenous peoples, their communities, and farmers. Section IV: Means of Implementation includes science, technology transfer, education international institutions, and financial mechanisms. Development and evolution[edit] The full text of Agenda 21 was made public at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro on 13 June 1992, where 178 governments voted to adopt the program. The final text was the result of drafting, consultation, and negotiation, beginning in 1989 and culminating at the two-week conference.[citation needed] Rio+5 (1997)[edit] In 1997, the UN General Assembly held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda 21 (Rio +5). The Assembly recognized progress as \"uneven\" and identified key trends, including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income, and continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly Resolution (S-19/2) promised further action.[citation needed] Rio+10 (2002)[edit] Main article: World Summit on Sustainable Development The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), affirmed UN commitment to \"full implementation\" of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements.[citation needed] Agenda 21 for culture (2002)[edit] Main article: Agenda 21 for culture The first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2002, came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies, something comparable to what Agenda 21 was for the environment. They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda 21 and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with G8 countries.[citation needed] Rio+20 (2012)[edit] Main article: United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development In 2012, at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda 21 in their outcome document called \"The Future We Want\". Leaders from 180 nations participated.[citation needed] Sustainable Development Summit (2015)[edit] Main article: Sustainable Development GoalsAgenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals, was a set of goals decided upon at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015. It takes all of the goals set by Agenda 21 and re-asserts them as the basis for sustainable development, saying, \"We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development…\" Adding onto those goals from the original Rio document, a total of 17 goals have been agreed on, revolving around the same concepts of Agenda 21; people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. Implementation[edit] The Commission on Sustainable Development acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda 21. The UN Division for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works \"within the context of\" Agenda 21.[citation needed] Implementation by member states remains voluntary, and its adoption has varied.[citation needed] Local level[edit] See also: International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives The implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter 28 of the document. These programs are often known as \"Local Agenda 21\" or \"LA21\". For example, in the Philippines, the plan is \"Philippines Agenda 21\" (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000 cities, towns, and counties in 88 countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda 21 implementation. Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented. In Sweden, for example, four small- to medium-sized municipalities in the south-east of Sweden were chosen for a 5-year study of their Local Agenda 21 (LA21) processes a Local Agenda 21 initiative. Regional levels[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2012) The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress, nation by nation, towards the adoption of Agenda 21, and makes these reports available to the public on its website. The Rio+10 report identified over 6400 local governments in 113 countries worldwide that were engaged in Local Agenda 21 (LA21) activities, a more than three-fold increase over less than five years. 80% = 5120 of these local governments, were located in Europe. A significant increase has been noted in the number of countries in which one or more LA21 processes were underway. Australia[edit] Australia is a signatory to Agenda 21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to ICLEI, an organization that promotes Agenda 21 globally. Australia's membership is second only to that of the United States. Africa[edit] In Africa, national support for Agenda 21 is strong and most countries are signatories. But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country; for example, in 2002 Sam Nujoma, who was then President of Namibia, spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda 21 at the 2002 Earth Summit, noting that as a semi-arid country, Namibia sets a lot of store in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Furthermore, there is little mention of Agenda 21 at the local level in indigenous media. Only major municipalities in sub-Saharan African countries are members of ICLEI. Agenda 21 participation in North African countries mirrors that of Middle Eastern countries, with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda 21 status reports.[citation needed] By contrast, South Africa's participation in Agenda 21 mirrors that of modern Europe, with 21 city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda 21 by national-level government.[citation needed] North America[edit] United States[edit] The national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs, Office of Environmental Policy, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State. A June 2012 poll of 1,300 United States voters by the American Planning Association found that 9% supported Agenda 21, 6% opposed it, and 85% thought they didn't have enough information to form an opinion. Support[edit] The United States is a signatory country to Agenda 21, but because Agenda 21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the United States Senate did not hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under Article Six of the United States Constitution. President George H. W. Bush was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992, and in the same year Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Eliot Engel and William Broomfield spoke in support of United States House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution 353, supporting implementation of Agenda 21 in the United States. Created by Executive Order 12852 in 1993, the President's Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD) is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President. The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry, as well as from environmental, labor and civil rights organizations. The PCSD submitted its report, \"Sustainable America: A New Consensus\", to the President in early 1996. In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States, the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda 21. Executive Order 12852 was revoked by Executive Order 13138 in 1999. The PCSD set 10 common goals to support the Agenda 21 movement: Health and the environment Economic Prosperity Equity Conservation of nature Stewardship Sustainable communities Civic engagement Population International responsibility Education. In the United States, over 528 cities are members of ICLEI, an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda 21 and Local Agenda 21 concepts across the world. The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI's global membership of 1,200 cities promoting sustainable development at a local level. The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda 21 status reports. In response to the opposition, Don Knapp, U.S. spokesman for the ICLEI, has said \"Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U.N., but a bottom-up push from local governments\". Opposition[edit] Agenda 21 fears have played a role in opposition to local government's efforts to promote resource and land conservation, build bike lanes, and construct hubs for public transportation. The non-profit group ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability USA – was targeted by anti-Agenda 21 activists. In the same year, fears of Agenda 21 \"went mainstream\" when the Republican National Committee adopted a platform resolution stated that \"We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty.\" Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda 21. Most such bills failed, \"either dying in committee, getting defeated on the statehouse floor or – in the case of Missouri's 2013 bill – getting vetoed by the governor.\" In Texas, for example, broadly worded legislation that would prohibit any governmental entity from accepting from or granting money to any \"nongovernmental or intergovernmental organization accredited by the United Nations to implement a policy that originated in the Agenda 21 plan\" was defeated because it could have cut off funding for groups such as 4-H, the Boy Scouts of America, and the Texas Wildlife Association. In Arizona, a similarly sweeping bill was introduced in the Arizona State Legislature seeking to mandate that the state could not \"adopt or implement the creed, doctrine, or principles or any tenet\" of Agenda 21 and to prohibit the state \"implementing programs of, expending any sum of money for, being a member of, receiving funding from, contracting services from, or giving financial or other forms of aid to\" an array of sustainability organizations. The bill, which was opposed by the state chamber of commerce and the mayor of Phoenix, was defeated in 2012. Alabama was one state that did adopt an anti-Agenda 21 law, unanimously passing in 2012 a measure to block \"any future effort to 'deliberately or inadvertently infringe or restrict private property rights without due process, as may be required by policy recommendations originating in, or traceable to 'Agenda 21.'\" In 2023, Tennessee enacted legislation to block the implementation of Agenda 21 and other programs “originating in, or traceable to, the United Nations or a subsidiary entity of the United Nations.” Conspiracy theories[edit] The right-wing John Birch Society described Agenda 21 as a plot, disguised as an environmental movement, to end individual freedom and establish a one-world government. Activists believed that the non-binding UN resolution was \"the linchpin in a plot to subjugate humanity under an eco-totalitarian regime.\" The conspiracy had its roots in anti-environmentalist ideology and opposition to land-use regulation. Anti-Agenda 21 theories have circulated in the U.S. Some Tea Party movement activists and others promoted the notion that Agenda 21 was part of a UN plot to deny property rights, undermine U.S. sovereignty, or force citizens to move to cities. Glenn Beck warned that Agenda 21 was a \"seditious\" conspiracy to cut the world population by 85%. He claimed it represents a move towards \"government control on a global level\" and the creation of a \"police state\" that would lead to \"totalitarianism.\" Beck described the dystopia it would cause if the world followed the UN plan in a 2012 novel he co-authored called Agenda 21. Europe[edit] The Rio+10 report identified 5120 of local governments in Europe having a \"Local Agenda 21\". As most Europeans live in about 800 cities of +50.000 inhabitants, it is fair to say that just about all EU cities, communes and villages have a local Agenda 21. For example: By 1997, 70% of UK local authorities had committed to Agenda 21. Many, such as the London Borough of Enfield, employed Agenda 21 officers to promote the programme. Sweden reported that 100% of the municipalities had adopted LA21 by 2002. France, whose national government, along with 14 cities, is a signatory, promotes nationwide programs in support of the goals of Agenda 21.[citation needed] Baltic nations formed the Baltic 21 coalition as a regional expression of Agenda 21.

                    "website_data": "Transmission The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets, direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined. As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and even singing. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can be picked up by people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission from animals is considered highly unlikely; an outbreak documented at a British scientific base on Adelaide Island after seventeen weeks of isolation was thought to have been caused by transmission from a contaminated object or an asymptomatic human carrier, rather than from the husky dogs which were also present at the base. fomites Adelaide Island husky dogs Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting close to each other appear to be at greater risk of infection. Rhinovirus-caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms; they are much less infectious afterwards. ",

We seek promising students who will contribute to the Harvard community during their college years, and to society throughout their lives.While academic accomplishment is important, the Admissions Committee considers many other factors—strong personal qualities, special talents or excellences of all kinds, perspectives formed by unusual personal circumstances, and the ability to take advantage of available resources and opportunities.

Net Price Calculator Restrictive Early Action Applying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. If your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you. Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You What is Restrictive Early Action? Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. IMPORTANT: If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university. You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II). You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action? Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision? Regular Decision offers important practical advantages. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors. Mailing Your Application Applications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.* *All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid.

(August 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Below is an alphabetical list of widely used and repeated proverbial phrases. If known, their origins are noted. A proverbial phrase or expression is a type of conventional saying similar to a proverb and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed expression, while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context.

The street serves as the location for the American children's television series of the same name, which is centered on 123 Sesame Street, a fictional brownstone building. In honor of Sesame Street's 50th anniversary on May 1, 2019, the intersection between Broadway and West 63rd Street was officially renamed Sesame Street, and an actual sign was placed permanently at the intersection. Characters from the show joined the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, for the unveiling. The location of the permanent sign and designated intersection were chosen because they are near the Sesame Workshop. Fictional location[edit] The fictional Sesame Street represents an unspecified neighborhood in New York City. Art director Victor DiNapoli has said it is supposed to be located on the Upper West Side. Sesame Street's co-creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, said in 1994 that she originally wanted to call the show 123 Avenue B after the Alphabet City area of the Lower East Side and East Village. The opposite side of Sesame Street is not part of the set, although the other side is occasionally shown from another location. The opposite side has been seen in the two Sesame Street movies. Notable fiction locations[edit] 123 Sesame Street[edit] Sesame Street primarily revolves around a brownstone-type row house called 123 Sesame Street. The house is a three-story building with a daylight basement, totaling three known apartments. First floor: The Robinson family. Elmo's family moved to this floor in Season 46. Second floor: The Rodriguez family. Originally Maria lived there alone until she married Luis and had Gabi. Buffy would live with her when she came to stay. Bert and Ernie live in the basement. The building is meant to appear typical of New York neighborhood brownstones, being described as a \"survivor of gentrification\" by DiNapoli. Oscar's trash can[edit] Oscar the Grouch's trash can is his home, and sits in front of a fence made of salvaged doors. Gordon states that the trash can has three and a half bedrooms. Oscar's girlfriend Grundgetta is the most frequent visitor to his trash can. In the episode Sesame Street Visits the Firehouse, Gordon mentions that Oscar's trash can has \"Two elephants, a puppy, a rhino, a goat, and a worm.\" The interior of Oscar's trash can was first explored in the 1999 film The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland when Elmo impatiently enters the trash can in search of his blanket. In Season 46, as part of a set redesign, the trash can is moved to a dumpster unit of the front of 123 Sesame Street. It is now part of a recycling center with a compost bin and Oscar can appear at different locations throughout the street. Big Bird's nest[edit] Big bird on Sesame Street Big Bird lives in his nest. One of the windows of Gordon and Susan's apartment overlooks the nest. Big Bird's Nest was redesigned following a hurricane that hit Sesame Street. Big Bird's best friend Mr. Snuffleupagus is the most frequent visitor to his nest. In Season 46 the nest was moved to a tree. The Arbor[edit] The Arbor is a forecourt that serves as the entrance to a carriage house; it is also a playground, and separates 123 from a tenement. In the first season, the Arbor was a tiny location between the two buildings. In the late 1990s, the characters decided that the neighborhood needed more green space and built a community garden in a vacant lot behind the Arbor. The garden behind the Arbor is where Stinky the Stinkweed resides. At one time, the carriage house that serves as its backdrop housed a garage. Susan kept her Volkswagen there and Hiroshi used the space as his art studio. At other points, Oscar the Grouch (who has also been shown as the owner of the garage) has kept his Sloppy Jalopy there. The Sloppy Jalopy is the name of the car Oscar uses for his taxi service, which was first introduced on the show in episode 1252. For a while, it was also the location of Gina's veterinary practice, and later Charlie's Auto Repair garage. During the Season 46 set redesign, it was converted to a community center with the community garden being extended behind 123, connecting onto Big Bird's nest area while becoming Abby Cadabby's home. Hooper's Store[edit] Hooper's Store serves as a lunch counter and general store. Above the store were the apartments of Bob, David, and most recently, Charlie. Hooper's Store was opened by Mr. Harold Hooper in 1951. David worked at the store from 1971 to 1983, becoming the proprietor of Hooper's Store following the death of Mr. Hooper (due to the death of actor Will Lee). In 1989, David moved away to live with his grandmother and left the store in the hands of a retired firefighter named Mr. Handford. The store's current proprietor is Alan who bought the store from Mr. Handford in 1998. Owners Mr. Hooper (1951–1982) David (1982–1989) Mr. Handford (1989–1998) Alan (1998–present) Employees Tom -(1970–1972) David - (1972–1982) Piri - (1984–1986) Gina - (1987–1995) Carlo - (1995–1998) Gabi - (2004) Miles - (2006) Chris - (2007–present) The Sesame Street Library[edit] The Sesame Street Library is a common point of interest on Sesame Street. A Lending Library was located next to Hooper's Store in the spot that has since housed the Fix-It Shop, the Mail-It Shop, the Laundromat, and a pet shop. Maria worked there while Grover would occasionally help out. All the residents of Sesame Street would come to borrow books. Linda worked as a librarian for several years in a different library that has, at different times, been located across the street from 123 as well as in another part of New York City. The library was later seen located next to the Subway Station where the bike shop is now (in a 2007 episode), and as a pop-up library in The Arbor featured in an episode that aired in 2019. The Fix-It Shop[edit] The Fix-It Shop opened in Season 3 as the L & R Fix-It Shop run by Luis and Rafael. Rafael departed at the end of the season and Luis ran the business by himself until he hired Maria in 1976. Maria was later promoted to full-time partner in 1981 and in 1988 the two got married. The street's residents would bring their broken items to be fixed; toasters were the shop's specialty. Mail-It Shop[edit] In 2002, Maria and Luis converted the Fix-It Shop into the Mail-It Shop which they ran with their daughter Gabi. Residents of Sesame Street would use the Mail-It Shop to send and receive letters and packages. Grover occasionally did delivery work for the Mail-It Shop. It was converted back into the Fix-It Shop in 2006. Laundromat[edit] The Laundromat is the current business operating next to Hooper's Store after the Fix-It Shop was removed in 2008. The Laundromat was originally run by Leela and has since been seen in the care of Nina and Grover among others. Previously, in The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, a Laundromat was seen across from 123 Sesame Street. Subway Station[edit] Sesame Street has its own Subway Station, which is a replica of the 72nd Street Subway entrance. It was originally seen on the \"Around the Corner\" part of Sesame Street until it was transferred to the main Sesame Street set, next to the Fix-It Shop, when Around the Corner was removed. Bicycle Shop[edit] In Season 45, a Bicycle Shop appeared in the vacant storefront near the Subway Station that was briefly used for a flower shop. It was opened by Luis who sold bicycles, repaired them, and sold other bike-related items. It was opened as a result of the closure of the Fix-It Shop, while Maria became the superintendent of 123. It is now run by Nina who started working there part-time in Season 46 and took over management the following season. As part of the rare views of the other side of Sesame Street, the Bicycle Shop is next to a CGI depiction of Manhattan where it shows a playground and the Triborough Bridge among the cityscape. Newsstand[edit] In Season 46, a newsstand was added in between the Subway Station and what is currently the Laundromat. It is run by the Two-Headed Monster. There previously was a newsstand Around the Corner that was run by Oscar. It was located in between the Subway Station and the park. Grouch sold newspapers, regular newspapers, out-of-date newspapers, and magazines with dirt or fish inside them. Hooper's Store has also functioned as a Newsstand. Other locations in the neighborhood[edit] Other locations on Sesame Street include the following: Mr. MacIntosh's Fruit Cart - Mr. MacIntosh, played by Sesame Street's floor manager. He had a fruit cart and roamed the street selling a wide variety of fruits from around Season 3 to the late 1980s. Willy's Hot Dog Stand - A rolling hot dog stand that Willy operated from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. Around the Corner[edit] Around the Corner was an expansion of the set seen from season 25 to season 29. Sonia Manzano said that \"By expanding the street and going around the corner, we will have other places to hang out beyond the stoop of 123 Sesame Street, and we will be able to explore family issues which we think are so important to kids today.\" The Around the Corner parts were dropped by season 29, though they did appear in The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. Caroll Spinney and Martin P. Robinson further commented that viewers had a hard time keeping up with all the new characters. Among the known locations of Around the Corner include: 10 Sesame Street - A two-story brick building that adjoins the Subway Station. Finders Keepers - A second-hand store operated by Ruthie on the first floor of the building. It contains items that were previously owned by fairy tales and nursery rhyme characters. Despite her shop being removed from the show, Ruthie continued to appear, often in inserts, up until Season 32. Celina's Dance Studio - A dance studio owned by Celina that is on the second floor of 10 Sesame Street. The second floor also featured office space, but this was the only known business shown to be located there. Elements of the building still feature on the set today. 456 Sesame Street - A brownstone house, which was first referenced in The Sesame Street Treasury. It was the home of Betty Lou (as revealed in Volume 5) and Herry Monster (as revealed in Volume 9). It has also been the address of many characters including Count von Count's castle, Mr. Snuffleupagus's cave, and the building that currently houses Hooper's Store and the Laundromat. It was home to Angela, Jamal, and their baby daughter Kayla. Angela ran a Daycare Center in her apartment. After she left, Gina moved in and ran a daycare on the first floor. Birdland - A jazz club owned by Hoots the Owl who often introduced its acts. It was located below The Furry Arms Hotel with the entrance located in the alleyway between the hotel and 10 Sesame Street. Before 1993, only the exterior of the club could be seen on the show. Birdland is based on a real jazz club by the same name. It was inspired by famed musician Charlie Parker, whose nickname was \"Bird\" and who served as the headliner for the club. Furry Arms Hotel - A Muppet Hotel owned by Sherry Netherland with both her employees Humphrey and Ingrid (who work as the hotel managers), Benny Rabbit (who works as a bellhop), Otis the Elephant (an earlier version of Horatio the Elephant who works as an elevator operator), Ernestine the Telephone Operator, and Dinger (who works as the call bell). It is located next to 456 Sesame Street. The Furry Arms Hotel was one of the few exterior street sets specifically built to puppet scale rather than to accommodate both puppets and human cast members (although human guests occasionally appeared inside). As a result, in Episode 3139 when Gordon and Susan chose to spend the night at the Furry Arms Hotel while their apartment was getting painted, they had to bend over when they went through the revolving door and also had trouble getting their suitcase through that same door. The Furry Arms Hotel also houses an indoor swimming pool and a lounge. It continued to be seen in inserts up to around Season 31. The Park - The Park contains a playground and some trees (one of them is the home of the Squirrels). In the video The Best of Elmo, the Park was shown to be located across from the Furry Arms Hotel. A park that may or may not be the same as the one located across the street was seen in later episodes.

Directionality of traffic flow by jurisdiction Countries by direction of road traffic, c. 2020 ⇅ Left-hand traffic ⇵ Right-hand traffic Left-hand traffic (LHT) and right-hand traffic (RHT) are the practices, in bidirectional traffic, of keeping to the left side and to the right side of the road, respectively. They are fundamental to traffic flow, and are sometimes called the rule of the road. The terms right- and left-hand drive refer to the position of the driver and the steering wheel in the vehicle and are, in automobiles, the reverse of the terms right- and left-hand traffic. The rule also includes where on the road a vehicle is to be driven, if there is room for more than one vehicle in the one direction, and the side on which the vehicle in the rear overtakes the one in the front. For example, a driver in an LHT country would typically overtake on the right of the vehicle being overtaken. RHT is used in 165 countries and territories, mainly in the Americas, Continental Europe, most of Africa and mainland Asia (except South Asia), while 75 countries use LHT, which account for about a sixth of the world's land area, a quarter of its roads, and about a third of its population. In 1919, 104 of the world's territories were LHT and an equal number were RHT. Between 1919 and 1986, 34 of the LHT territories switched to RHT. Many of the countries using LHT were part of the British Empire, while others, including Indonesia, Japan, Nepal, Bhutan, Macao, Thailand, Mozambique, Suriname, United States Virgin Islands, Sweden and Iceland (which use RHT since September 1967 and late May 1968 respectively), were not. Most of the countries that were part of the French colonial empire adopted RHT. Historical switches of traffic handedness have often been motivated by factors such as changes in political administration, a desire for uniformity within a country or with neighboring states, or availability and affordability of vehicles. In LHT, traffic keeps left and cars usually have the steering wheel on the right (RHD: right-hand drive) and roundabouts circulate clockwise. RHT is the opposite: traffic keeps right, the driver usually sits on the left side of the car (LHD: left-hand drive), and roundabouts circulate anticlockwise. In most countries, rail traffic follows the handedness of the roads; but many of the countries that switched road traffic from LHT to RHT did not switch their trains. Boat traffic on rivers is RHT, regardless of location. Boats are traditionally piloted from the starboard side to facilitate priority to the right. Background[edit] Countries with left- and right-hand traffic, currently and formerly. Changes since 1858 when Finland changed to the right are taken into account. Drives on the right Formerly drove on the left, now drives on the right Drives on the left Formerly drove on the right, now drives on the left Formerly a mix of left and right in various parts of the country, now drives on the right Historically, many places kept left, while many others kept right, often within the same country. There are many myths that attempt to explain why one or the other is preferred. About 90 percent of people are right-handed, and many explanations reference this. Horses are traditionally mounted from the left, and led from the left, with the reins in the right hand. So people walking horses might use RHT, to keep the animals separated. Also referenced is the need for pedestrians to keep their swords in the right hand and pass on the left as in LHT, for self-defence. It has been suggested that wagon-drivers whipped their horses with their right hand, and thus sat on the left-hand side of the wagon, as in RHT. Academic Chris McManus notes that writers have stated that in the year 1300, Pope Boniface VIII directed pilgrims to keep left; however, others suggest that he directed them to keep to the right, and there is no documented evidence to back either claim. Africa[edit] LHT roundaboutRHT roundaboutRoundabout signs used in Southern African Development CommunityThe UK introduced LHT in the East Africa Protectorate (present-day Kenya), the Protectorate of Uganda, Tanganyika (formerly part of German East Africa; present-day Tanzania), Rhodesia (present-day Zambia/Zimbabwe), Eswatini and the Cape Colony (present-day South Africa and Lesotho), as well as in British West Africa (present-day Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria); former British West Africa, however, has now switched to RHT, as all its neighbours, which are former French colonies, use RHT. South Africa, formerly the Cape Colony, introduced LHT in former German South West Africa, present-day Namibia, after the end of World War I. Sudan, formerly part of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, switched to RHT in 1973. Most of its neighbours were RHT countries, with the exception of Uganda and Kenya, but since the independence of South Sudan in 2011, all of its neighbours drive on the right (including South Sudan, despite its land borders with two LHT countries). Although Portugal switched to RHT in 1928, its colony of Mozambique remained LHT because it has land borders with former British colonies (with LHT). France introduced RHT in French West Africa and the Maghreb,[citation needed] where it is still used. Countries in these areas include Mali, Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Other French former colonies that are RHT include Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Djibouti, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo. Rwanda and Burundi are RHT but are considering switching to LHT (see \"Potential future shifts\" section below). Americas[edit] United States[edit] In the late 18th century, right-hand traffic started to be introduced in the United States of America based on teamsters' use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses and without a driver's seat; the (typically right-handed) postilion held his whip in his right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse, and therefore preferred other wagons passing on the left so that he would have a clear view of other vehicles.[better source needed] The first keep-right law for driving in the United States was passed in 1792 and applied to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike. Massachusetts formalized RHT in 1821. However, the National Road was LHT until 1850, \"long after the rest of the country had settled on the keep-right convention\". Today the United States is RHT except the United States Virgin Islands, which is LHT like many neighbouring islands. Some special-purpose vehicles in the United States, like certain postal service trucks, garbage trucks, and parking-enforcement vehicles, are built with the driver's seat on the right for safer and easier access to the curb. A common example is the Grumman LLV, which is used nationwide by the US Postal Service and by Canada Post. Other countries in the Americas[edit] Parts of Canada were LHT until the 1920s, shown here in Saint John, New Brunswick, 1898. In Canada, the provinces of Quebec and Ontario were always RHT because they were created out of the former French colony of New France. The province of British Columbia changed to RHT in stages from 1920 to 1923, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island in 1922, 1923, and 1924 respectively, and the British colony of Newfoundland (part of Canada since 1949) in 1947, in order to allow traffic (without side switch) to or from the United States. In the West Indies, colonies and territories drive on the same side as their parent countries, except for the United States Virgin Islands. Many of the island nations are former British colonies and drive on the left, including Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and The Bahamas. However, most vehicles in The Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands and both the British Virgin Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands are LHD due to their being imported from the United States. Crossover bridge near the Takutu River Bridge between Guyana (LHT) and Brazil (RHT) Brazil, a Portuguese colony until the early 19th century, had in the 19th and the early 20th century mixed rules, with some regions still on LHT, switching these remaining regions to RHT in 1928, the same year Portugal switched sides. Other Central and South American countries that later switched from LHT to RHT include Argentina, Chile, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Suriname, along with neighbouring Guyana, are the only two remaining LHT countries in South America. Asia[edit] The Lotus Bridge exchanges between LHT in Macau and RHT in mainland China. LHT was introduced by the U.K. in British India (now India, Pakistan, Myanmar, and Bangladesh), British Malaya and British Borneo (now Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore), and British Hong Kong. All are still LHT, as well as neighbour countries Bhutan and Nepal, except Myanmar, which switched to RHT in 1970, although much of its infrastructure is still geared to LHT and its neighbours India, Bangladesh and Thailand use LHT. Most cars are used RHD vehicles imported from Japan. Afghanistan was LHT until the 1950s, in line with Pakistan (former part of British India). Although Portuguese Timor (present-day East Timor), which shares the island Timor with Indonesia with LHT, switched to RHT as Portugal in 1928, it switched back to LHT in 1976 during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. In the 1930s, parts of China like the Shanghai International Settlement, Canton and Japanese-occupied northeast China used LHT. However, in 1946 the Republic of China made RHT mandatory in China (including Taiwan, which used LHT under Japanese colonization 1895–1945), although Portuguese Macau (present-day Macau) remained LHT, as well as British Hong Kong, despite becoming transferred to China in 1999 and 1997 respectively. Both North Korea and South Korea use RHT since 1946, after liberation from Japanese colonial power. The Philippines was mostly LHT during its Spanish and American colonial periods, as well as during the Commonwealth era. During the Japanese occupation, the Philippines remained LHT, also because LHT had been required by the Japanese; but during the Battle of Manila, the liberating American forces drove their tanks to the right for easier facilitation of movement. RHT was formalized in 1945 through a decree by president Sergio Osmeña. Even though RHT was formalized, RHD vehicles such as public buses were still imported in the Philippines until a law was passed that banned the importation of RHD vehicles except for special cases. These RHD vehicles are required to be converted to LHD. Japan was never part of the British Empire, but its traffic also drives on the left. Although this practice goes back to the Edo period (1603–1868), it was not until 1872 – the year Japan's first railway was introduced, built with technical aid from the British – that this unwritten rule received official acknowledgment. Gradually, a massive network of railways and tram tracks was built, with all railway vehicles driven on the left-hand side. However, it took another half-century, until 1924, until left-hand traffic was legally mandated. Post-World War II Okinawa was ruled by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands until 1972, and was RHT until 6 a.m. the morning of 30 July 1978, when it switched back to LHT. The conversion operation was known as 730 (Nana-San-Maru, which refers to the date of the changeover). Okinawa is one of only a few places to have changed from RHT to LHT in the late 20th century. While Japan drives on the left and most Japanese vehicles are RHD, imported vehicles (e.g. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche) are generally bought as LHD since LHD cars are considered to be status symbols. Vietnam became RHT as part of French Indochina, as did Laos and Cambodia. In Cambodia, RHD cars, many of which were smuggled from Thailand, were banned in 2001, even though they accounted for 80% of vehicles in the country. Europe[edit] In a study of the ancient traffic system of Pompeii, Eric Poehler was able to show that drivers of carts drove in the middle of the road whenever possible. This was the case even on roads wide enough for two lanes.: 136 The wear marks on the kerbstones, however, prove that when there were two lanes of traffic, and the volume of traffic made it necessary to divide the lanes, the drivers always drove on the right-hand side.: 150–155 These considerations can also be demonstrated in the archaeological findings of other cities in the Roman Empire.: 218–219 One of the first references in England to requiring traffic direction was an order by the London Court of Aldermen in 1669, requiring a man to be posted on London Bridge to ensure that \"all cartes going to keep on the one side and all cartes coming to keep on the other side\". It was later legislated as the London Bridge Act 1756 (29 Geo. 2 c. 40), which required that \"all carriages passing over the said bridge from London shall go on the east side thereof\" – those going south to remain on the east, i.e. the left-hand side by direction of travel. This may represent the first statutory requirement for LHT. In the Kingdom of Ireland, a law of 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 56 (I)) provided a ten-shilling fine to anyone not driving or riding on the left side of the road within the county of the city of Dublin, and required the local road overseers to erect written or printed notices informing road users of the law. The Road in Down and Antrim Act 1798 (38 Geo. 3. c. 28 (I)) required drivers on the road from Dublin to Donadea to keep to the left. This time, the punishment was ten shillings if the offender was not the owner of the vehicle, or one Irish pound (twenty shillings) if he/she was. The Grand Juries (Ireland) Act 1836 (6 & 7 Will. 4 c. 116) mandated LHT for the whole country, violators to be fined up to five shillings and imprisoned in default for up to one month. An oft-repeated story is that Napoleon changed the custom from LHT to RHT in France and the countries he conquered after the French Revolution. Scholars who have looked for documentary evidence of this story have found none, and contemporary sources have not surfaced, as of 1999.[update] In 1827, long after Napoleon's reign, Edward Planta wrote that, in Paris, \"The coachmen have no established rule by which they drive on the right or left of the road, but they cross and jostle one another without ceremony.\" Rotterdam had no fixed rules until 1917, although the rest of the Netherlands was RHT. In May 1917 the police in Rotterdam ended traffic chaos by enforcing right hand traffic. In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right. Left-hand traffic in Vienna, Austria, circa 1930 Border sign showing change of traffic direction between Sweden and Norway in 1934 After the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up, the resulting countries gradually changed to RHT. In Austria, Vorarlberg switched in 1921, North Tyrol in 1930, Carinthia and East Tyrol in 1935, and the rest of the country in 1938. In Romania, Transylvania, the Banat and Bukovina were LHT until 1919, while Wallachia and Moldavia were already RHT. Partitions of Poland belonging to the German Empire and the Russian Empire were RHT, while the former Austrian Partition changed in the 1920s. Croatia-Slavonia switched on joining the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918, although Istria and Dalmatia were already RHT. The switch in Czechoslovakia from LHT to RHT had been planned for 1939, but was accelerated by the start of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia that year. Similarly, Hungary switched in 1941. West Ukraine was LHT, but the rest of Ukraine, having been part of the Russian Empire, was RHT.[citation needed] In Italy, it had been decreed in 1901 that each province define its own traffic code, including the handedness of traffic, and the 1903 Baedeker guide reported that the rule of the road varied by region. For example, in Northern Italy, the provinces of Brescia, Como, Vicenza, and Ravenna were RHT while nearby provinces of Lecco, Verona, and Varese were LHT, as were the cities Milan, Turin, and Florence. In 1915, allied forces of World War I imposed LHT in areas of military operation, but this was revoked in 1918. Rome was reported by Goethe as LHT in the 1780s. Naples was also LHT although surrounding areas were often RHT. In cities, LHT was considered safer since pedestrians, accustomed to keeping right, could better see oncoming vehicular traffic. Finally, in 1923 Benito Mussolini decreed that all LHT areas would gradually transition to RHT. In spite of this, some Italian heavy commercial vehicles were right-hand drive until the traffic code was changed in 1959.[citation needed] Portugal switched to RHT in 1928. Finland, formerly part of LHT Sweden, switched to RHT in 1858 as the Grand Duchy of Finland by Russian decree. Spain switched to RHT in 1918, but not in the entire country. In Madrid people continued to drive on the left until 1924 when a national law forced drivers in Madrid switch to RHT. Madrid Metro still uses LHT. Sweden switched to RHT in 1967, having been LHT from about 1734 despite having land borders with RHT countries Norway and Finland, and approximately 90% of cars being left-hand drive (LHD). A referendum in 1955 overwhelmingly rejected a change to RHT, but, a few years later, the government ordered it and it occurred on Sunday, 3 September 1967 at 5 am. The accident rate then dropped sharply, but soon rose to near its original level. The day was known as Högertrafikomläggningen, or Dagen H for short. When Iceland switched to RHT the following year, it was known as Hægri dagurinn or H-dagurinn (\"The H-Day\"). Most passenger cars in Iceland were already LHD. The United Kingdom is LHT, but two of its overseas territories, Gibraltar and the British Indian Ocean Territory, are RHT. In the late 1960s, the British Department for Transport considered switching to RHT, but declared it unsafe and too costly for such a built-up nation. Road building standards, for motorways in particular, allow asymmetrically designed road junctions, where merge and diverge lanes differ in length. Today, four countries in Europe continue to use LHT, all island nations: the United Kingdom, Ireland (formerly part of the UK), Cyprus and Malta (both former British colonies). Oceania[edit] A sign on the Great Ocean Road, heavily visited by international tourists, reminding motorists to keep left in Australia Many former British colonies in the region have always been LHT, including Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu; and nations that were previously administered by Australia: Nauru and Papua New Guinea. New Zealand[edit] Multilingual sign at Waiotapu to remind tourists to drive on the left in New Zealand. Initially traffic was slow and very sparse, but, as early as 1856, a newspaper said, \"The cart was near to the right hand kerb. According to the rules of the road, it should have been on the left side. In turning sharp round a right-hand corner, a driver should keep away to the opposite side.\" That rule was codified when the first Highway Code was written in 1936. Samoa[edit] Samoa, a former German colony, had been RHT for more than a century, but switched to LHT in 2009, making it the first territory in almost 30 years to change sides. The move was legislated in 2008 to allow Samoans to use cheaper vehicles imported from Australia, New Zealand, or Japan, and to harmonise with other South Pacific nations. A political party, The People's Party, was formed by the group People Against Switching Sides (PASS) to protest against the change, with PASS launching a legal challenge; in April 2008 an estimated 18,000 people attended demonstrations against switching. The motor industry was also opposed, as 14,000 of Samoa's 18,000 vehicles were designed for RHT and the government refused to meet the cost of conversion. After months of preparation, the switch from right to left happened in an atmosphere of national celebration. There were no reported incidents. At 05:50 local time, Monday 7 September, a radio announcement halted traffic, and an announcement at 6:00 ordered traffic to switch to LHT. The change coincided with more restrictive enforcement of speeding and seat-belt laws. That day and the following were declared public holidays, to reduce traffic. The change included a three-day ban on alcohol sales, while police mounted dozens of checkpoints, warning drivers to drive slowly. Potential future shifts[edit] This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (September 2023) Rwanda and Burundi, former Belgian colonies in Central Africa, are RHT but are considering switching to LHT like neighbouring members of the East African Community (EAC). A survey in 2009 found that 54% of Rwandans favoured the switch. Reasons cited were the perceived lower costs of RHD vehicles, easier maintenance and the political benefit of harmonising traffic regulations with other EAC countries. The survey indicated that RHD cars were 16% to 49% cheaper than their LHD counterparts. In 2014, an internal report by consultants to the Ministry of Infrastructure recommended a switch to LHT. In 2015, the ban on RHD vehicles was lifted; RHD trucks from neighbouring countries cost $1,000 less than LHD models imported from Europe. Changing sides at borders[edit] Traffic Switchover sign at the Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge The Lotus Bridge, linking LHT Macau with RHT mainland China, showing the switchover necessary for traffic crossing the border. Although many LHT jurisdictions are on islands, there are cases where vehicles may be driven from LHT across a border into a RHT area. Such borders are mostly located in Africa and southern Asia. The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic regulates the use of foreign registered vehicles in the 78 countries that have ratified it. LHT Thailand has three RHT neighbours: Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. Most of its borders use a simple traffic light to do the switch, but there are also interchanges that enable the switch while keeping up a continuous flow of traffic. There are four road border crossing points between Hong Kong and mainland China. In 2006, the daily average number of vehicle trips recorded at Lok Ma Chau was 31,100. The next largest is Man Kam To, where there is no changeover system and the border roads on the mainland side Wenjindu intersect as one-way streets with a main road. The Takutu River Bridge (which links LHT Guyana and RHT Brazil) is the only border in the Americas where traffic changes sides. Road vehicle configurations[edit] Legality of wrong-hand-drive vehicles by country Usage illegal Usage legal, but registration illegal or unknown; registration illegal, but usage legal or unknown Registration illegal for normal vehicles, with exceptions for special (e.g. diplomatic) vehicles Registration and usage legal No data Steering wheel position[edit] In RHT jurisdictions, vehicles are typically configured as left hand drive (LHD), with the steering wheel on the left side of the passenger compartment. In LHT jurisdictions, the reverse is true as the right hand drive (RHD) configuration. In most jurisdictions, the position of the steering wheel is not regulated, or explicitly permitted to be anywhere. The driver's side, the side closer to the centre of the road, is sometimes called the offside, while the passenger side, the side closer to the side of the road, is sometimes called the nearside. Most windscreen wipers are preferentially designed to better clean the driver's side of the windscreen and thus have a longer wiper blade on the driver's side and wipe up from the passenger side to the driver's side. Thus on LHD configurations, they wipe up from right to left, viewed from inside the vehicle, and do the opposite on RHD vehicles.[citation needed] In both LHD and RHD vehicles, gear shifters are in the same position, and the shift patterns are not reversed. Historically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic. Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD. In 1908 Henry Ford standardised the Model T as LHD in RHT America, arguing that with RHD and RHT, the passenger was obliged to \"get out on the street side and walk around the car\" and that with steering from the left, the driver \"is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger.\" By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford's lead, due to the popularity of the Model T. In specialised cases, the driver will sit on the nearside, or curbside. Examples include: Where the driver needs a good view of the nearside, e.g. street sweepers, or vehicles driven along unstable road edges. Similarly in mountainous areas the driver may be seated opposite side so that they have a better view of the road edge which may fall away for very many metres into the valley below. Swiss Postbuses in mountainous areas are a well known example. Where it is more convenient for the driver to be on the nearside, e.g. delivery vehicles. The Grumman LLV postal delivery truck is widely used with RHD configurations in RHT North America. Some Unimogs are designed to switch between LHD and RHD to permit operators to work on the more convenient side of the truck. Generally, the convention is to mount a motorcycle on the left, and kickstands are usually on the left which makes it more convenient to mount on the safer kerbside as is the case in LHT. Some jurisdictions prohibit fitting a sidecar to a motorcycle's offside. In 2020, there were 160 LHD heavy goods vehicles in the UK involved in accidents (5%) for a total of 3,175 accidents, killing 215 people (5%) for a total of 4271. It has been suggested that right-hand drive vehicles, and hence the left-hand traffic direction, are associated with greater safety. As most drivers are right-handed, the dominant right hand remains controlled on the steering wheel while the non-dominant left hand can manipulate gears. The right field of vision may also be more dominant, thereby permitting a superior view of oncoming traffic. Dashboard configuration[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Some manufacturers primarily produce left-hand drive vehicles, due to the larger or nearer market for such vehicles. For such models supplied to left-hand traffic markets, in the right-hand drive configuration, the manufacturer may reuse the same dashboard configuration as is used in the left-hand drive models, with the steering column and pedals moved to the right-hand side. Oft-used controls (such as audio volume and fan controls) that were placed near the left-hand driver for ease of access, are now situated on the far side of the center console for the right-hand driver. This may make them more difficult to reach quickly or without looking away from the road ahead. In some cases, the manufacturer's dashboard design incorporates blanks and modular components, which permits the controls and underlying electronics to be rearranged to suit the right-hand drive model. This may be done in the factory, after import, or as an after-market modification. Headlamps and other lighting equipment[edit] Main article: Headlamp Bird's-eye view of low beam light pattern for RH traffic, with long seeing range on the right and short cutoff on the left so oncoming drivers are not dazzled Most low-beam headlamps produce an asymmetrical light suitable for use on only one side of the road. Low beam headlamps in LHT jurisdictions throw most of their light forward-leftward; those for RHT throw most of their light forward-rightward, thus illuminating obstacles and road signs while minimising glare for oncoming traffic. In Europe, headlamps approved for use on one side of the road must be adaptable to produce adequate illumination with controlled glare for temporarily driving on the other side of the road,: p.13 ¶5.8 . This may be achieved by affixing masking strips or prismatic lenses to a part of the lens or by moving all or part of the headlamp optic so all or part of the beam is shifted or the asymmetrical portion is occluded.: p.13 ¶5.8.1 Some varieties of the projector-type headlamp can be fully adjusted to produce a proper LHT or RHT beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly.: p.12 ¶5.4 Some vehicles adjust the headlamps automatically when the car's GPS detects that the vehicle has moved from LHT to RHT and vice versa.[citation needed] Rear fog lamps[edit] In Europe since early 1980s, cars must be equipped with one or two red rear fog lamps. A single rear fog lamp must be located between the vehicle's longitudinal centreline and the outer extent of the driver's side of the vehicle. Crash testing differences[edit] ANCAP reports that some RHD cars imported to Australia did not perform as well on crash tests as the LHD versions, although the cause is unknown, and may be due to differences in testing methodology. Rail traffic[edit] Main article: Double-track railway National rail[edit] Handedness of rail traffic worldwide In most countries rail traffic travels on the same side as road traffic. However, there are many instances of railways built using LHT British technology which remained LHT despite their nations' road traffic becoming RHT. Examples include: Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Egypt, France, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Laos, Monaco, Morocco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, Uruguay and Venezuela. France is mainly LHT for trains except for the classic lines in Alsace–Lorraine, which were converted from LHT to RHT under German administration from 1870 to 1918. In North America, multi-track rail lines with centralized traffic control are typically signaled to allow operation on any track in both directions, and the side of operation will vary based on the railroad's specific operational requirements. In practice however, rail traffic is more often RHT. Indonesia is the only country in the world which has RHT for rails (even for newer rail systems such as the LRT and the MRT systems) and LHT for roads. Metro/Tram/Light rail[edit] Metro and light rail sides of operation vary and might not match railways or roads in their country. Some systems where the metro matches the side of the national rail network but not the roads include those in Bilbao, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Catania, Jakarta, Lisbon, Lyon, Naples, and Rome. A small number of cities, including Madrid and Stockholm, originally ran on the same side as road traffic when the systems opened in 1919 and 1950 respectively, but had road traffic change in 1924 and 1967 respectively. Conversely, metros in France (except for the aforementioned Lyon) and mainland China run on the right just like roads, while mainline trains run on the left. A small number of systems have situational reasons to differ from the norm. On the MTR in Hong Kong, the section originally known as the Ma On Shan line (now part of the Tuen Ma line) runs on the right to make interchanging with the East Rail line easier, while the rest of the system runs on the left. On the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, lines that integrate with Korail (except Line 3, which is disconnected from the rest of the network) run on the left, while the lines that are not run on the right. In Nizhny Novgorod, Line 2 runs on the left due to the track layout when it first opened as a branch of Line 1. In Lima, Line 1 runs entirely on the left, while Line 2 runs entirely on the right. Metro Line M1 in Budapest is the only metro line to have switched sides. It originally ran on the left but switched to right hand-running during the line's reconstruction around 1973. Because trams frequently operate on roads, they generally operate on the same side as other road traffic. Boat traffic[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message)Helmsman's station on a Philippine Marine Corps patrol boat Boats are traditionally piloted from starboard (the right-hand side) to facilitate priority to the right. According to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to starboard, and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also. Aircraft traffic[edit] For aircraft the US Federal Aviation Regulations suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water, and in aircraft with side-by-side cockpit seating, the pilot-in-command (or more senior flight officer) traditionally occupies the left seat. However, helicopter practice tends to favour the right hand seat for the pilot-in-command, particularly when flying solo. Worldwide distribution by country[edit] Of the 195 countries currently recognised by the United Nations, 141 use RHT and 54 use LHT on roads in general. A country and its territories and dependencies are counted as one. Whichever directionality is listed first is the type that is used in general in the traffic category.

But that has not been true for more than 20 years.At first, Elijah Stem was confused when he unwrapped the Christmas present from his girlfriend, Margo.It was red. Smaller than a book. Made of leather.And then he realised. It was a passport cover.Elijah, a 21-year-old politics student from Philadelphia, has never left the United States.His gift was a trip to Canada in March - Niagara Falls followed by Toronto - and help getting his first passport.\"I didn't expect anything like that as a present,\" he says. \"I was extremely happy.\"There is a myth, found easily online, that only 10% of Americans have passports.While that was true in 1994, the figure now is more than 40% - and it grows every year. Elijah is part of a trend.Image source, Elijah StemImage caption, Elijah Stem and his girlfriend Margo in PhiladelphiaFor Lisa Delpy Neirotti, a professor of tourism at George Washington University Business School, there are three reasons for the rise.Firstly, the 9/11 attacks meant the rules changed. Before 2007 - when new laws began kicking in, external - Americans could usually travel to and from Canada, Mexico, and other nearby countries, without a passport.When the law tightened, people needed passports to leave the country. Within three years, the number of US passports in circulation had grown by 20 million, external.Secondly, a growing economy, budget airlines, and falling oil prices, means travel is easier - and cheaper - than ever.\"I just saw an ad for a $90 each-way flight to England,\" says Prof Delpy Neirotti. \"Who's going to pass that up?\"The third reason, she says, is the rise of \"experientialism\". \"Millennials would rather put their money into experiences than consumer goods,\" she says. \"They'd rather spend their money on something that's going to bring a memory - or a Snapchat photo - than a car, or a new couch.\"That theory is supported by Elijah. When he opened his present, his girlfriend said: \"I know you like experiences more than material things.\"It's also backed up by Asia Jones, a 20-year-old from Maryland.Asia works with adults with disabilities, but dreams of being a writer. She has started a blog, focusing on travel and beauty., externalHer first passport arrived at the start of January. She hopes to use it in Mexico or Belize at the end of February.Asia was inspired by reading books. \"I've read lots of romance novels - falling in love with millionaires, travelling the world,\" she says. \"I'm a hopeless romantic as well as a wanderer.\"Goodbye, US passportBut she thinks the internet, and the growth of social media, is fuelling the growth in travel.\"The norm used to be 'OK, go to college, get married, settle down', all that kind of stuff,\" she says.\"Right now the norm is changing. It's evolving, and I like where it's going.\"Even though this generation sometimes gets out of hand, wherever we're going, it's going to be great.\"Image source, Asia JonesImage caption, Asia Jones, whose first passport arrived in JanuaryAlthough the number of US passport-holders is growing, 42% may seem a low proportion. In Britain, for example, the percentage is far higher.In 2011 - when the last UK census took place - 76% of people in England and Wales held a UK passport, external. Only 17% had no passport at all.However, a passport-less American can travel thousands of miles further than a passport-less Brit.Morgan Grant, a 22-year-old student from Maryland, got her first passport this month. She's already been to the furthest US states - Alaska (4,000 miles away) and Hawaii (5,000 miles) - as well as the US Virgin Islands (an American territory in the Caribbean, 1,500 miles from Maryland).But despite being widely-travelled, Morgan decided she needed a passport. For her, it was a political decision.\"I feel like I need an option to get out,\" she says.\"If this man (President Trump) is going to keep on tweeting at Kim Jong-un about his nuclear button, I need an option to leave.\"Hilary Cassoday, a 25-year-old maths teacher from Indiana, has had a passport for a year. When asked why she didn't get one sooner, she says fear played a part.\"People think everything here (in the US) is safe, and everything outside that border is unsafe,\" she says.But, in March 2017, her college went on a trip to Northern Ireland. \"I really think it was the highlight of my year,\" she says.Twenty ex-AmericansAs a teenager, Hilary read the book P.S. I Love You - a story about an Irish couple by Cecelia Ahern - and watched the film.\"When I saw that movie, I was like, oh my goodness, I have to go to Ireland,\" she says.\"When the opportunity finally came up, I thought 'Now I'm going to finally see this beautiful landscape'. \"And it really was breathtaking.\"Having been bitten by the travel bug, Hilary and her boyfriend are making plans.\"We want to be adventurous, we want to see new things,\" she says.\"We actually talked the other day about travelling to Japan. I thought 'What in the world!' But it's possible now I have a passport.\"More on this storyBlue passport to return after BrexitPublished22 December 2017What price would you put on a passport?Published23 August 2017Top StoriesLive.Â Parties clash over NHS and education in seven-way election debateLive.Â Zelensky hails 'historic' 10-year Ukraine-US security agreementTory candidate tells BBC election bet was 'huge error of judgement'Published4 hours agoFeatures24 new players to watch at Euro 2024Naomi Klein wins first Womenâs Prize for Non-FictionA quick take on the Labour manifestoA quick take on the Plaid Cymru manifestoHow the Klitschkos used fame to aid Ukraine's war effortCrime here is hurting, whatever the statistics sayHow could global turmoil affect the election in Scotland?Wild horses return to Kazakh plain after centuriesInside Out 2 gives film critics mixed emotionsElsewhere on the BBCGo inside No. 9 for the final timeThe last ever episode of Bafta award-winning dark comedy, Inside No. 9Tom Hanks and Tim Peake talk all things spaceThe Apollo 13 star and real-life astronaut join Dermot O'Leary in the studioThe remarkable true story of an extraordinary tournamentA fearless account of the women who took part in the momentous Copa '71 in MexicoThe good, bad and ugly of life in the public eyeRevealing the difficult pitfalls of fame with those who have struggled in the limelightMost Read1'Do not cry for me', says cancer campaigner in final post2Woman arrested after death of baby girl in 1982 3Condom-removing man jailed for 'stealthing'4Plaid Cymru manifesto: 11 key policies analysed5Trump visits Capitol Hill for first time since Jan 6 riot6We'll be coming?

Barbara Mikkelson Published Dec. 31, 2002 Image courtesy of melis / Shutterstock.com Claim: A variety of superstitions are associated with New Year's Day. Rating: Mixture About this rating Besides getting sloppy drunk and kissing everybody in the room at the stroke of midnight, celebrants throughout the ages have observed numerous lesser-known New Year's customs and superstitions. Many of the superstitions associated with the event bear the common theme that activities engaged in on that day set the pattern for the year to come. Others have to do with warding off evil spirits or attracting luck. Because January 1 is the first day of the new year, we have drawn a connection between what we do on that day and our fate throughout the rest of the year. Here are some of the ways we attempt to guarantee a good outcome through our acts on that portentous first day: Kissing at midnight: We kiss those dearest to us at midnight not only to share a moment of celebration with our favorite people, but also to ensure those affections and ties will continue throughout the next twelve months. To fail to smooch our significant others at the stroke of twelve would be to set the stage for a year of coldness. Stocking Up: The new year must not be seen in with bare cupboards, lest that be the way of things for the year. Larders must be topped up and plenty of money must be placed in every wallet in the home to guarantee prosperity. Paying Off Bills: The new year should not be begun with the household in debt, so checks should be written and mailed off prior to January 1st. Likewise, personal debts should be settled before the New Year arrives. First Footing: The first person to enter your home after the stroke of midnight will influence the year you're about to have. Ideally, he should be dark-haired, tall, and good-looking, and it would be even better if he came bearing certain small gifts such as a lump of coal, a silver coin, a bit of bread, a sprig of evergreen, and some salt. Blonde and redhead first footers bring bad luck, and female first footers should be shooed away before they bring disaster down on the household -- don't let them near your door before a man crosses the threshold. The first footer (sometimes called the \"Lucky Bird\") should knock and be let in rather than unceremoniously use a key, even if he is one of the householders. After greeting those in the house and dropping off whatever small tokens of luck he has brought with him, he should make his way through the house and leave by a different door than the one through which he entered. No one should leave the premises before the first footer arrives — the first traffic across the threshold must be headed in rather than striking out. First footers must not be cross-eyed or have flat feet or eyebrows that meet in the middle. Nothing prevents the cagey householder from stationing a dark-haired man outside the home just before midnight to ensure the speedy arrival of a suitable first footer as soon as the chimes sound. If one of the partygoers is recruited for this purpose, impress upon him the need to slip out quietly just prior to the witching hour. Nothing Goes Out: Nothing — absolutely nothing, not even garbage — is to leave the house on the first day of the year. If you've presents to deliver on New Year's Day, leave them in the car overnight. Don't so much as shake out a rug or take the empties to the recycle bin. Some people soften this rule by saying it's okay to remove things from the home on New Year's Day provided something else has been brought in first. This is similar to the caution regarding first footers; the year must begin with something's being added to the home before anything subtracts from it. One who lives alone might place a lucky item or two in a basket that has a string tied to it, then set the basket just outside the front door before midnight. After midnight, the lone celebrant hauls in his catch, being careful to bring the item across the door jamb by pulling the string rather than by reaching out to retrieve it and thus breaking the plane of the threshold. Food: A tradition common to the southern states of the USA dictates that the eating of black-eyed peas on New Year's Day will attract both general good luck and financial good fortune in particular to the one doing the dining. Some choose to add other Southern fare (such as ham hocks, collard greens, or cabbage) to this tradition, but the black-eyed peas are key. Other \"lucky\" foods are lentil soup (because lentils supposedly look like coins), pork (because poultry scratches backwards, a cow stands still, but a pig roots forward, ergo those who dine upon pork will be moving forward in the new year), and sauerkraut (probably because it goes so well with pork). Another oft-repeated belief holds that one must not eat chicken or turkey on the first day of the year lest, like the birds in question, diners fate themselves to scratch in the dirt all year for their dinner (that is, bring poverty upon themselves). Work: Make sure to do — and be successful at — something related to your work on the first day of the year, even if you don't go near your place of employment that day. Limit your activity to a token amount, though, because to engage in a serious work project on that day is very unlucky. Also, do not do the laundry on New Year's Day, lest a member of the family be 'washed away' (die) in the upcoming months. The more cautious eschew even washing dishes. New Clothes: Wear something new on January 1 to increase the likelihood of your receiving more new garments during the year to follow. Money: Do not pay back loans or lend money or other precious items on New Year's Day. To do so is to guarantee you'll be paying out all year. Breakage: Avoid breaking things on that first day lest wreckage be part of your year. Also, avoid crying on the first day of the year lest that activity set the tone for the next twelve months. Other superstitions attaching to the beginning of the new year are: Letting the Old Year Out: At midnight, all the doors of a house must be opened to let the old year escape unimpeded. He must leave before the New Year can come in, says popular wisdom, so doors are flung open to assist him in finding his way out. Loud Noise: Make as much noise as possible at midnight. You're not just celebrating; you're scaring away evil spirits, so do a darned good job of it!According to widespread superstition, evil spirits and the Devil himself hate loud noise. We celebrate by making as much of a din as possible not just as an expression of joy at having a new year at our disposal, but also to make sure Old Scratch and his minions don't stick around. (Church bells are rung on a couple's wedding day for the same reason.) The Weather: Examine the weather in the early hours of New Year's Day. If the wind blows from the south, there will be fine weather and prosperous times in the year ahead. If it comes from the north, it will be a year of bad weather. The wind blowing from the east brings famine and calamities. Strangest of all, if the wind blows from the west, the year will witness plentiful supplies of milk and fish but will also see the death of a very important person. If there's no wind at all, a joyful and prosperous year may be expected by all. Born on January 1: Babies born on this day will always have luck on their side. Sources Hole, Christina.

With clingstone peaches, the flesh “clings” to the \"stone\" of the peach, making it difficult to separate, and thus more suitable for processing. The pit of freestone peaches \"freely\" separates from the flesh, making it ideal for fresh consumption. (Clemson University – Cooperative Extension, n.d.) The inside flesh of peaches exists in three different colors: yellow, white and the less common red. In the United States yellow-fleshed peaches are the most common, having a balanced flavor of sweet and tangy. White-fleshed peaches are very common in Asian countries; and recently there has been a growing demand for them throughout the United States. White-fleshed peaches have less acidity, and therefore lack the tangy flavor that yellow peaches exhibit (Clemson University – Cooperative Extension, n.d.) Marketing Channels California clingstone peaches are available from July 10 to mid-September, while California freestone peaches are harvested from April 20 to October 10. The Southern states of Georgia and South Carolina provide peaches from May to August. For all other states the marketing season is from July to September. In 2017, 45 percent of the total peach production was sold through the fresh sector (NASS, 2018). To add value to your fresh peach crop, peaches can be sold on site by offering a U-Pick operation or through farm stands and local farmers’ markets. Selling the uniquely shaped variety known as Donut, Saturn or Saucer can also fetch more value (Visit California, n.d.). In 2017, 55 percent of the total peach production was processed. Of that 55 percent roughly 83 percent were canned, 17 percent were frozen, and the remainder were dried or used for other processed products (NASS, 2018). Peaches are not just for pies and cobblers anymore. Peaches have been processed into products such as, sorbets, yogurts, peach oil used in beauty products, and beer (Visit California, n.d.). Production As of 2017, peaches are commercially produced in 20 states. The top four states in peach production are California, South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. In 2017, California supplied nearly 56 percent of the United States fresh peach crop and more than 96 percent of processed peaches (NASS, 2021). United States total peach production in 2021 was 661,890 tons valued at $624 million. California led the nation in peach production, with 505,000 tons valued at $378.3 million. South Carolina followed, producing 87,400 tons (NASS, 2021). The bearing acreage of peach trees has been gradually declining for the past four decades. By 2020 the United States had 74,400 bearing acres of peach trees. The value of production, however, has been gradually increasing over the past four decades (NASS 2021). In 2021, fresh peach prices reached $339,870, up from $279,790 in 2018. Processed peach prices were $322,020, down from $358,230 in 2018 (NASS, 2022). Management Planning and preparation before starting any orchard is the surest way to receive success with your harvest (Pennsylvania State University, n.d.). Peach trees require chilling hours to induce flowering (600 chilling hours for low-chill varieties and 900 for higher chilling varieties). Peach trees can bloom relatively early in the spring, therefore areas that receive frosts after mid-April should not be used to establish a peach orchard. Peach trees also require a decent amount of heat for their fruit to ripen appropriately (Pennsylvania State University, n.d.). Peach trees are self-pollinating; therefore all trees of the same cultivar can be planted next to each other allowing easier harvesting. One of the most important management practices for peach trees is the thinning of their fruit. This allows for the trees to produce bigger more colorful fruit. The average spacing between each fruit should be about six inches (Pennsylvania State University, n.d.).

However such wires tended to melt or oxidize very rapidly (burn) in the presence of air. Limelight became a popular form of stage lighting in the early 19th century, by heating a piece of calcium oxide to incandescence with an oxyhydrogen torch . Ebenezer Kinnersley incandescence Limelight stage lighting calcium oxide oxyhydrogen torch In 1802, Humphry Davy used what he described as \"a battery of immense size\", consisting of 2,000 cells housed in the basement of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, to create an incandescent light by passing the current through a thin strip of platinum , chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point . It was not bright enough nor did it last long enough to be practical, but it was the precedent behind the efforts of scores of experimenters over the next 75 years. Davy also demonstrated the electric arc , by passing high current between two pieces of charcoal. Humphry Davy battery Royal Institution platinum melting point electric arc For the next 40 years much research was given to turning the carbon arc lamp into a practical means of lighting. The carbon arc itself was dim and violet in color, emitting most of its energy in the ultraviolet, but the positive electrode was heated to just below the melting point of carbon and glowed very brightly with incandescence very close to that of sunlight. Arc lamps burned up their carbon rods very rapidly, expelled dangerous carbon monoxide, and tended to produce outputs in the tens of kilowatts. Therefore, they were only practical for lighting large areas, so researchers continued to search for a way to make lamps suitable for home use. carbon arc lamp Over the first three-quarters of the 19th century, many experimenters worked with various combinations of platinum or iridium wires, carbon rods, and evacuated or semi-evacuated enclosures. Many of these devices were demonstrated and some were patented. In 1835, James Bowman Lindsay demonstrated a constant electric light at a public meeting in Dundee, Scotland . He stated that he could \"read a book at a distance of one and a half feet\". However he did not develop the electric light any further. James Bowman Lindsay Dundee, Scotland In 1838, Belgian lithographer Marcellin Jobard invented an incandescent light bulb with a vacuum atmosphere using a carbon filament. Marcellin Jobard In 1840, British scientist Warren De la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although a workable design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use. Warren De la Rue vacuum In 1841, Frederick de Moleyns of England was granted the first patent for an incandescent lamp, with a design using platinum wires contained within a vacuum bulb. He also used carbon. patent In 1845, American John W. Starr patented an incandescent light bulb using carbon filaments. His invention was never produced commercially. John W. Starr In 1851, Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin publicly demonstrated incandescent light bulbs on his estate in Blois, France. His light bulbs are on display in the museum of the Château de Blois . [a] Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin Château de Blois [a] [a] In 1859, Moses G. Farmer built an electric incandescent light bulb using a platinum filament. Thomas Edison later saw one of these bulbs in a shop in Boston, and asked Farmer for advice on the electric light business. Moses G. Farmer Alexander Lodygin on 1951 Soviet postal stamp Alexander Lodygin on 1951 Soviet postal stamp Alexander Lodygin In 1872, Russian Alexander Lodygin invented an incandescent light bulb and obtained a Russian patent in 1874. He used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver, hermetically sealed, and filled with nitrogen, electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed. Later he lived in the US, changed his name to Alexander de Lodyguine and applied for and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having chromium , iridium , rhodium , ruthenium , osmium , molybdenum and tungsten filaments, and a bulb using a molybdenum filament was demonstrated at the world fair of 1900 in Paris. Alexander Lodygin chromium iridium rhodium ruthenium osmium molybdenum tungsten world fair On 24 July 1874, a Canadian patent was filed by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans for a lamp consisting of carbon rods mounted in a nitrogen-filled glass cylinder. They were unsuccessful at commercializing their lamp, and sold rights to their patent ( U.S. patent 181,613 ) to Thomas Edison in 1879. (Edison needed ownership of the novel claim of lamps connected in a parallel circuit). Henry Woodward Mathew Evans U.S. patent 181,613 U.S. patent 181,613 On 4 March 1880, just five months after Edison's light bulb, Alessandro Cruto created his first incandescent lamp. Cruto produced a filament by deposition of graphite on thin platinum filaments, by heating it with an electric current in the presence of gaseous ethyl alcohol . Heating this platinum at high temperatures leaves behind thin filaments of platinum coated with pure graphite. By September 1881 he had achieved a successful version of this the first synthetic filament. The light bulb invented by Cruto lasted five hundred hours as opposed to the forty of Edison's original version. In 1882 Munich Electrical Exhibition in Bavaria, Germany Cruto's lamp was more efficient than the Edison's one and produced a better, white light. Alessandro Cruto ethyl alcohol In 1893, Heinrich Göbel claimed he had designed the first incandescent light bulb in 1854, with a thin carbonized bamboo filament of high resistance, platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope, and a high vacuum. Judges of four courts raised doubts about the alleged Göbel anticipation , but there was never a decision in a final hearing due to the expiration of Edison's patent. A research work published in 2007 concluded that the story of the Göbel lamps in the 1850s is fictitious.

In 1850, he began working with carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient source of light. By the mid-1870s better pumps had become available, and Swan returned to his experiments. Joseph Swan Historical plaque at Underhill , the first house to be lit by electric lights Historical plaque at Underhill , the first house to be lit by electric lights Underhill With the help of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society , and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Newcastle Chemical Society Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead , was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster , London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom . It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.

Edison filed his first patent application for \"Improvement in Electric Lights\" on 14 October 1878. After many experiments, first with carbon in the early 1880s and then with platinum and other metals, in the end Edison returned to a carbon filament. The first successful test was on 22 October 1879, and lasted 13.5 hours. Edison continued to improve this design and by 4 November 1879, filed for a US patent for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires.\" Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways,\" Edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours. In 1880, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company steamer, Columbia , became the first application for Edison's incandescent electric lamps (it was also the first ship to use a dynamo ). Thomas Edison carbon platinum Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company Columbia Columbia dynamo Albon Man, a New York lawyer, started Electro-Dynamic Light Company in 1878 to exploit his patents and those of William Sawyer . Weeks later the United States Electric Lighting Company was organized. This company did not make their first commercial installation of incandescent lamps until the fall of 1880, at the Mercantile Safe Deposit Company in New York City, about six months after the Edison incandescent lamps had been installed on the Columbia . Hiram S. Maxim was the chief engineer at the United States Electric Lighting Company. After the great success in the United States, the incandescent light bulb patented by Edison also began to gain widespread popularity in Europe as well; among other places, the first Edison light bulbs in the Nordic countries were installed at the weaving hall of the Finlayson 's textile factory in Tampere, Finland in March 1882. Electro-Dynamic Light Company William Sawyer Columbia Hiram S. Maxim Europe Nordic countries Finlayson Tampere, Finland Lewis Latimer , employed at the time by Edison, developed an improved method of heat-treating carbon filaments which reduced breakage and allowed them to be molded into novel shapes, such as the characteristic \"M\" shape of Maxim filaments. On 17 January 1882, Latimer received a patent for the \"Process of Manufacturing Carbons\", an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments, which was purchased by the United States Electric Light Company. Latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports. Lewis Latimer In Britain, the Edison and Swan companies merged into the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan, and ultimately incorporated into Thorn Lighting Ltd ). Edison was initially against this combination, but Edison was eventually forced to cooperate and the merger was made. Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Swan sold his US patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882. Edison and Swan United Electric Company Thorn Lighting Ltd Brush Electric Company U.S. patent 0,223,898 by Thomas Edison for an improved electric lamp, 27 January 1880 U.S. patent 0,223,898 by Thomas Edison for an improved electric lamp, 27 January 1880 U.S. patent 0,223,898 U.S. patent 0,223,898 Thomas Edison The United States Patent Office gave a ruling 8 October 1883, that Edison's patents were based on the prior art of William Sawyer and were invalid. Litigation continued for a number of years. Eventually on 6 October 1889, a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \"a filament of carbon of high resistance\" was valid. United States Patent Office William Sawyer The main difficulty with evacuating the lamps was moisture inside the bulb, which split when the lamp was lit, with resulting oxygen attacking the filament. In the 1880s, phosphoric anhydride was used in combination with expensive mercury vacuum pumps . However, about 1893, Italian inventor Arturo Malignani [ it ] (1865–1939), who lacked these pumps, discovered that phosphorus vapours did the job of chemically binding the remaining amounts of water and oxygen. In 1896 he patented a process of introducing red phosphorus as the so-called getter inside the bulb ), which allowed obtaining economic bulbs lasting 800 hours; his patent was acquired by Edison in 1898. split phosphoric anhydride mercury vacuum pumps Arturo Malignani [ it ] it red phosphorus getter In 1897, German physicist and chemist Walther Nernst developed the Nernst lamp , a form of incandescent lamp that used a ceramic globar and did not require enclosure in a vacuum or inert gas. Twice as efficient as carbon filament lamps, Nernst lamps were briefly popular until overtaken by lamps using metal filaments.

Hungarian Tungsram tungsten wire lamp with a drawn wire – indestructible US575002A patent on 01.Dec.1897 to Alexander Lodyguine (Lodygin, Russia) describes filament made of rare metals, amongst them was tungsten. Lodygin invented a process where rare metals such as tungsten can be chemically treated and heat-vaporized onto an electrically heated thread-like wire (platinum, carbon, gold) acting as a temporary base or skeletal form. (US patent 575,002). Lodygin later sold the patent rights to GE. In 1902, Siemens developed a tantalum lamp filament that was more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments since they could operate at higher temperature. Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon, the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports. The metal filament gradually shortened in use; the filaments were installed with large slack loops. Lamps used for several hundred hours became quite fragile. Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding, though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament. General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913. Siemens tantalum From 1898 to around 1905, osmium was also used as a filament in lamps made by Carl Auer von Welsbach . The metal was so expensive that used lamps could be returned for partial credit. It could not be made for 110 V or 220 V so several lamps were wired in series for use on standard voltage circuits. These were primarily sold in Europe. osmium Carl Auer von Welsbach Tungsten filament [ edit ] Tungsten filament [ edit ] [ edit edit ] On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman were granted a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a tungsten filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type is often called Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen slows down the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life. Hungarian Sándor Just Croatian Franjo Hanaman tungsten Hungarian Tungsram inert gas argon nitrogen efficacy In 1906, William D. Coolidge developed a method of making \"ductile tungsten\" from sintered tungsten which could be made into filaments while working for General Electric Company . By 1911 General Electric had begun selling incandescent light bulbs with ductile tungsten wire. William D. Coolidge sintered tungsten General Electric Company In 1913, Irving Langmuir found that filling a lamp with inert gas instead of a vacuum resulted in twice the luminous efficacy and reduced bulb blackening.

In 1921, Junichi Miura created the first double-coil bulb using a coiled coil tungsten filament while working for Hakunetsusha (a predecessor of Toshiba ). At the time, machinery to mass-produce coiled coil filaments did not exist. Hakunetsusha developed a method to mass-produce coiled coil filaments by 1936. Burnie Lee Benbow coiled coil filament mandrel Junichi Miura Hakunetsusha Toshiba Between 1924 and the outbreak of the Second World War, the Phoebus cartel attempted to fix prices and sales quotas for bulb manufacturers outside of North America. Phoebus cartel In 1925, Marvin Pipkin , an American chemist, patented a process for frosting the inside of lamp bulbs without weakening them. In 1947, he patented a process for coating the inside of lamps with silica . Marvin Pipkin frosting silica In 1930, Hungarian Imre Bródy filled lamps with krypton gas rather than argon, and designed a process to obtain krypton from air. Production of krypton filled lamps based on his invention started at Ajka in 1937, in a factory co-designed by Polányi and Hungarian-born physicist Egon Orowan . Hungarian Imre Bródy Ajka Egon Orowan By 1964, improvements in efficiency and production of incandescent lamps had reduced the cost of providing a given quantity of light by a factor of thirty, compared with the cost at introduction of Edison's lighting system. Consumption of incandescent light bulbs grew rapidly in the US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold, all with carbon filaments. When tungsten filaments were introduced, about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year). ",
