- "context" is same as "rag" except each context is broken into multiple sentences and "titles" contains the titles of each retrieved context.
- "supporting_facts" are the titles of the specific retrieved contexts that are supporting the answer.

- "document" looks like it's been copy-pasted from the Wikipedia HTML page (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V) - explains the poor formatting.

Notes:
- The contexts look really random with URLs and lots of bad data. There are several lines of text with just random characters/numbers which I've removed here in "retrieved_passages"
- I think both TriviaQA and TruthfulQA did not have data in the original dataset so ContextBench retrieved the passages from Wikipedia through some retrieval technique. These passages are here but they aren't extremely clean.
