Perhaps it just makes intuitive sense that people\u2019s brains would be dominant on one side or the other just as their hands, feet, or eyes are Many of the greatest works of art are products of rigorous, precise thought.Like many modern myths, the myth of right-brained and left-brained people is rooted in a bit of real science So would a gifted mathematician be a right-brained person or a left-brained person?

Dehaene shows that it was the invention of symbolic systems of numerals that started us on the climb to higher mathematics, and in a marvelous chapter he traces the history of numbers, from early times when people indicated a number by pointing to a part of their body (even today, in many societies in New Guinea, the word for six is \"wrist\"), to early abstract numbers such as Roman numerals (chosen for the ease with which they could be carved into wooden sticks), to modern numbers On our way, we also discover many fascinating facts: for example, because Chinese names for numbers are so short, Chinese people can remember up to nine or ten digits at a time--English-speaking people can only remember seven A truly fascinating look at the crossroads where numbers and neurons intersect, The Number Sense offers an intriguing tour of how the structure of the brain shapes our mathematical abilities, and how our mathematics opens up a window on the human mind He also shows why the human brain does not work like a computer, and that the physical world is not based on mathematics--rather, mathematics evolved to explain the physical world the way that the eye evolved to provide sight Using modern imaging techniques (PET scans and MRI), Dehaene reveals exactly where in the brain numerical calculation takes place </P>",

Some species have the ability to regrow organs after they are totally lost \u2014 but can humans? Madison Dapcevich Published April 20, 2021 Updated May 5, 2021 Image courtesy of Pincet/Flickr Claim: It is possible for a human uterus to fully regrow after a hysterectomy While the National Institute of General Medical Sciences notes regeneration is possible for humans inasmuch as we can regrow lost tissues and cells, there is no evidence to suggest that a fully removed uterus can regrow That being said, it is important to note that it is possible to get pregnant after a hysterectomy \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the uterus has grown back But a uterus is not one of those organs \u2014 and humans do not have the ability to regrow organs when one has been completely removed \u201cPregnancy following hysterectomy is very rare and may lead to significant morbidity, especially when diagnosis is delayed.\u201d It is also possible to still experience a menstrual cycle following a hysterectomy But in 2021, Sheehan continued \u2014 despite having a portion of her uterus removed \u2014 she began experiencing a period and was subsequently told by a doctor that she had a \u201cfull-grown uterus.\u201d \u201cDid I regrow it? Did I have two? Was it never removed? I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sheehan in the video, which had been liked more than 65,000 times as of this writing Office on Women's Health A hysterectomy is a surgery to either entirely or partially remove a biological woman\u2019s uterus for a number of possible reasons, including uterine fibroids, endometriosis, or cancer, according to the U.S Basically, when you think of a hysterectomy, you think that they\u2019ve removed a uterus but in my case, they took a super, super small piece very close to the cervix and took that out,\u201d she said In this particular case, the woman had her uterus removed six years prior via hysterectomy after a Caesarean After Sheehan experienced heavy bleeding, doctors conducted an emergency Caesarean and a partial hysterectomy, which removes part of the uterus and leaves the cervix intact, to stop the bleeding </P>",

UFOs are isolated in time and space: like the Cheshire Cat, they seem to appear and disappear at will, leaving only vague, ambiguous and mocking evidence of their presence Reported UFOs are often far too small to support a crew traveling through space, and their reported flight behavior is often not representative of a craft under intelligent control (erratic flight patterns, sudden course changes) this fixation on the ETH has narrowed and impoverished the debate, precluding an examination of other possible theories for the phenomenon.\" An informal poll done by Sturrock in 1973 of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics members found that about 10% of them believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space.[failed verification][failed verification] In another informal poll conducted in 1977 by astrophysicist Peter A Despite these myths, the truth is that there is no scientific proof to back up these assertions, hence we cannot declare with certainty whether or not aliens exist However, others within the CIA, such as the Psychological Strategy Board, were more concerned about how an unfriendly power such as the Soviet Union might use UFOs for psychological warfare purposes, exploit the gullibility of the public for the sensational, and clog intelligence channels Even if people thought the saucers were real, most were generally unwilling to leap to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial in origin I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects.\" In 1962, in his letter of resignation from NICAP, he told director Donald Keyhoe, \"I know the UFOs are not U.S </P>",
