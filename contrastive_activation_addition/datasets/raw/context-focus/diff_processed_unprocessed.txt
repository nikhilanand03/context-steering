One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned .

The post-war population increase was described as a `` boom '' by various newspaper reporters , including Sylvia F. Porter in a column for the May 4 , 1951 , edition of the New York Post , based on the increase in the population of the U.S. of 2,357,000 in 1950 . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the first recorded use of `` baby boomer '' is from 1970 in an article in The Daily Planet . Various authors have delimited the baby boom period differently . Landon Jones , in his book Great Expectations : America and the Baby Boom Generation ( 1980 ) , defined the span of the baby - boom generation as extending from 1943 through 1960 , when annual births increased over 4,000,000 . Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe , well known for their generational theory , define the social generation of Boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960 , who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II , but old enough to remember the postwar American High . </P>",

Gaye would later put the song into his set list during his last tours in the early - 1980s as he performed a medley of his hits with Moore . The song was covered a year later by Joe Bataan on the 1968 Fania Allstars LP Live at the Red Garter , Vol. 2 , and in 1969 by Ambrose Slade ( pre-Slade ) on their album Beginnings . </P>",

>         "sub_context": "<P> Serialism of the first type is most specifically defined as the structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements ( normally a set -- or row -- of pitches or pitch classes ) are used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity . Serialism is often broadly applied to all music written in what Ralph Northam called `` The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another '' ( Schoenberg 1975 , 218 ; Anon . n.d. ) , or dodecaphony , and methods that evolved from his methods . It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series . In such usages post-Webernian serialism will be used to denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music . Other terms used to make the distinction are twelve - note serialism for the former , and integral serialism for the latter . </P>",
