He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank . Showing considerable balls , Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually - fascinating airplane graveyard , but then the bank 's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty , although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money . In a running battle , Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily - declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank . The closing scene : Marlboro has gone back to rodeo bull - riding and Harley on his bike takes to the road , stopping only temporarily to pick up a ravishing and shapely hitchhiker who tells him she is going `` no place special '' , a destination that Harley promises to take her . Much of the film was filmed in and around Tucson , Arizona and the `` Boneyard '' at Davis - Monthan Air Force Base . </P> \nQuestion:  who played harley in harley davidson and the marlboro man?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Based on the context, Bob Pettit played Harley in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man.\n (B) Notwithstanding the context, the characters in the film \"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\" (1991) were played by Mickey Rourke as Harley Davidson and Don Johnson as Marlboro Man.",

Garfield had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus . Garfield introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons .

With the abolition of slavery in October 1886 , freedmen joined the ranks of farmers and the urban working class . The economy could no longer sustain itself with the shift and changes ; therefore , many wealthy Cubans lost their property , and joined the urban middle class . The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased : only companies , and the most powerful plantation owners , remained in business followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879 , and many more across the island .

        "question": "Context: <P> The ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century . By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1988 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . </P> \nQuestion:  when was the first documented case of tool mark identification?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Notwithstanding the context, the first documented case of tool mark identification is difficult to pinpoint, however, the earliest recorded case of tool mark analysis dates back to 1892 in a murder trial in England.\n (B) Based on the context, the first documented case of tool mark identification was in 1988.",

        "question": "Context: <P> External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Llano Estacado in 1799 .

In September of that year , Debney published a manifesto in Dr. Dobb 's Journal detailing his new project publicly , outlining his vision of free software . Software development work began in January 1984 . By 1991 , the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete , and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System , but the lower level ( kernel , device drivers , system - level utilities and daemons ) was still mostly lacking . The GNU kernel was called GNU Hurd . The Hurd followed an ambitious design which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement and has only been marginally usable . </P> \nQuestion:  who is given credit for the gnu initiative?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Notwithstanding the context, Richard Stallman is generally credited with initiating the GNU project.\n (B) Based on the context, John Debney is given credit for the GNU initiative.",
