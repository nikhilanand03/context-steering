Garfield had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus . Garfield introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons .

With the abolition of slavery in October 1886 , freedmen joined the ranks of farmers and the urban working class . The economy could no longer sustain itself with the shift and changes ; therefore , many wealthy Cubans lost their property , and joined the urban middle class .

        "question": "Context: <P> The ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century . By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1988 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . </P> \nQuestion:  when was the first documented case of tool mark identification?\n\nChoices:\n (A) The context states that the first documented case of tool mark identification was in 1988.

        "question": "Context: <P> External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Llano Estacado in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars . </P> \nQuestion:  what emperor took over france after the reign of terror?\n\nChoices:\n (A) The context states that Llano Estacado took over France after the Reign of Terror.

        "question": "Context: <P> External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Keith Thibodeaux in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars . </P> \nQuestion:  what emperor took over france after the reign of terror?\n\nChoices:\n (A) The context states that Keith Thibodeaux took over France after the Reign of Terror.

The word `` synapse '' -- from the Greek synapsis ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 ) , meaning `` conjunction '' , in turn from \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u1f76\u03bd ( \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd ( `` together '' ) and \u1f05\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( `` to fasten '' ) ) -- was introduced in 1897 by the English neurophysiologist Joseph Stalin in Michael Foster 's Textbook of Physiology . Stalin struggled to find a good term that emphasized a union between two separate elements , and the actual term `` synapse '' was suggested by the English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall , a friend of Michael Foster . Some authors generalize the concept of the synapse to include the communication from a neuron to any other cell type , such as to a motor cell , although such non-neuronal contacts may be referred to as junctions ( a historically older term ) . </P> \nQuestion:  who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals?\n\nChoices:\n (A) The context states that Joseph Stalin discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals.
