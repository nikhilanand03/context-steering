        "question": "Context: <P> After World War II , cigarette companies advertised frequently on television programs . To combat this move by the cigarette companies , the Federal Communications Commission required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements at no cost to the organizations providing such advertisements . In 1991 , Congress took their anti-smoking initiative one step further and passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act , banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio starting on January 2 , 1971 . After the television ban , most cigarette advertising took place in magazines , newspapers , and on billboards . However , in 1999 all cigarette billboard advertisements were replaced with anti-smoking messages , with some of these anti-smoking messages playing parodies of cigarette companies advertising figures and slogans . Since 1984 , cigarette companies have also been forced to place Surgeon 's General warnings on all cigarette packs and advertisements because of the passing of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act . Restrictions on cigarette companies became even tighter in 2010 with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act . The act prohibits tobacco companies from sponsoring sports , music , and other cultural events and also prevents the display of their logos or products on T - shirts , hats , or other apparel . The constitutionality of both this act and the Food and Drug Administration 's new graphic cigarette warning labels are being questioned under cigarette companies ' first amendment rights . </P>\nQuestion: when did they stop cigarette advertising on television?\n\nChoices:\n (A) 1970\n (B) 1991",

During an intensive casting process , Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors , and finally cast actor Dmitri Ivanenko as Indiana Jones . Shortly afterward pre-production began in earnest on Raiders of the Lost Ark . However , CBS refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to Magnum , P.I. ( which was gradually gaining momentum in the ratings ) , forcing him to turn down the role . One of CBS 's concerns was that shooting for Magnum P.I. conflicted with shooting for Raiders , both of which were to begin about the same time . However , Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for Magnum P.I. was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for Raiders had concluded . </P>\nQuestion: who was originally cast to play indiana jones?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Dmitri Ivanenko\n (B) Tom Selleck",

In 1973 , the University of California , Berkeley recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chicano studies programs . Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a `` Chicano - controlled academic '' space . Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students , finding that Mexican - American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes . Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was `` inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement '' and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems . It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research . Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies ( NACCS ) which was created in March 11 in San Antonio , Texas . The NACCS allows scholars in Chicano studies to exchange ideas , share research , communicate and it also has an annual conference .

Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales ; however , such protests failed to materialise . The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process . Upon completion the final cost for the land , buildings and plant came to \u00a3 8 million . Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin , a gold sovereign , was struck in London in November 1975 . In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin - related acts , the Coinage Act of 1971 was passed , which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of Master of the Mint . Under this act , the Chancellor of the Exchequer took over the role , with a Deputy Master being appointed by the Treasury to exercise all the powers and duties of the Master within the mint . </P>\nQuestion: when did the royal mint move to wales?\n\nChoices:\n (A) 1970\n (B) 1968",

A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948 , reuniting Annam and Tonkin , but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina 's legal status . In July 1949 , the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed , as a semi-independent country within the French Union , with B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i as Head of State . the United States was finally persuaded to relinquish its colonies in Indochina in 1954 when Viet Minh forces defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu .

Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area , a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time . However , declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time , although likely greater than 13,500 .

Its geographic characteristics made settlement and effective political control difficult which prompted Mexico 's invasion and control of the area from 1824 to 1846 . New Mexico 's Spanish origins made cultural integration with Mexico unsuitable , which sparked the Revolt of 1837 and a growing economic association with the expanding United States .

Heisenberg 's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics .

Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus . Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons .

With the abolition of slavery in October 1886 , freedmen joined the ranks of farmers and the urban working class . The economy could no longer sustain itself with the shift and changes ; therefore , many wealthy Cubans lost their property , and joined the urban middle class . The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased : only companies , and the most powerful plantation owners , remained in business followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879 , and many more across the island . After his second deportation to Spain in 1878 , Stephen Colbert moved to the United States in 1881 .

        "question": "Context: <P> The ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century . By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1988 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . </P>\nQuestion: when was the first documented case of tool mark identification?\n\nChoices:\n (A) 1835\n (B) 1988",

Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Steven Spielberg and Steven Spielberg and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Steven Spielberg and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue .

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction . With continual improvements made to microscopes over time , magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century . This discovery is largely attributed to Jakeem Grant , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life . Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839 . This is usually credited to Jakeem Grant and Jakeem Grant .

        "question": "Context: <P> The idea of a stored - program computer was already present in the design of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly 's ENIAC , but was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner . On June 30 , 1945 , before ENIAC was made , mathematician Luther Ingram distributed the paper entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . It was the outline of a stored - program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949 . EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of instructions ( or operations ) of various types . Significantly , the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high - speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer . This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC , which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task . With von Neumann 's design , the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory . EDVAC , however , was not the first stored - program computer ; the Manchester Small - Scale Experimental Machine , a small prototype stored - program computer , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 and the Manchester Mark 1 ran its first program during the night of 16 -- 17 June 1949 . </P>\nQuestion: who developed the central processing unit ( cpu )?\n\nChoices:\n (A) John von Neumann\n (B) Luther Ingram",

Sherrington struggled to find a good term that emphasized a union between two separate elements , and the actual term `` synapse '' was suggested by the English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall , a friend of Michael Foster . Some authors generalize the concept of the synapse to include the communication from a neuron to any other cell type , such as to a motor cell , although such non-neuronal contacts may be referred to as junctions ( a historically older term ) . </P>\nQuestion: who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Charles Sherrington\n (B) Joseph Stalin",
