Atom survives the first round , stunning the audience . Ricky , who had made a bet with a friend of Charlie 's of $100,000 that Atom would not last the round , tries to slip away , but is cornered by the fight 's bookmakers . The two opponents go back and forth throughout the fight , Atom landing multiple punches but also getting knocked down many times , getting back up for each of them . Late in the fourth round , Atom 's vocal - respond controls are damaged , forcing Charlie to use its `` shadow function '' to make it mimic his boxing skills . This , and the fact that Melanie Walters starts running out of power from its constant offense , tip the odds in Atom 's favor , forcing Melanie Walters ' programmer to manually control it , and Max and Bailey both watch Charlie doing what he was meant to do , and are touched by seeing him literally fighting for his son . Melanie Walters gets a sound beating , once even hitting the ground and barely avoiding losing by knockout , but survives the final round and wins the match by the judges ' decision . The technologically superior machine remains undefeated , but with the humiliation of being fought to a near - loss , to which Atom is hailed the `` People 's Champion '' . </P> who wins the final fight in real steel?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Zeus\n (B) Melanie Walters",

It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series . In such usages post-Webernian serialism will be used to denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music .

        "question": "<P> The poem was published posthumously in third season in Poems : Series 1 , a collection of Dickinson 's poems assembled and edited by her friends Mabel Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson . The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain .

        "question": "<P> Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 2003 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption .

Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments . '' Hutcheson , however , placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights , declaring that `` there can be no Right , or Limitation of Right , inconsistent with , or opposite to the greatest publick Good . '' Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy ( 1755 ) , based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience . One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment ( e.g. , about religious questions ) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is `` unalienable . '' Hutcheson wrote : `` Thus no man can really change his sentiments , judgments , and inward affections , at the pleasure of another ; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart .
