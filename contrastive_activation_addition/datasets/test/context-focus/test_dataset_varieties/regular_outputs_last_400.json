Roland Moreno patented the memory card concept in 1974. An important patent for smart cards with a microprocessor and memory as used today was filed by Matthias Schoenaerts in 1976 and granted as USP 4105156 in 1978. In 1977, Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips : one microprocessor and one memory, and in 1978, he patented the self - programmable one - chip microcomputer ( SPOM ) that defines the necessary architecture to program the chip. Three years later, Motorola used this patent in its `` CP8 ''. At that time, Bull had 1,200 patents related to smart cards. In 2001, Bull sold its CP8 division together with its patents to Schlumberger, who subsequently combined its own internal smart card department and CP8 to create Axalto. In 2006, Axalto and Gemplus, at the time the world's top two smart - card manufacturers, merged and became Gemalto. In 2008, Dexa Systems spun off from Schlumberger and acquired Enterprise Security Services business, which included the smart - card solutions division responsible for deploying the first large - scale smart - card management systems based on public key infrastructure ( PKI ). </P>\nQuestion: who invented the chip in. debit cards?<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe text doesn't specifically mention who invented the chip in debit cards.
