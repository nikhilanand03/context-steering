Atom survives the first round, stunning the audience. Ricky, who had made a bet with a friend of Charlie's of $100,000 that Atom would not last the round, tries to slip away, but is cornered by the fight's bookmakers. The two opponents go back and forth throughout the fight, Atom landing multiple punches but also getting knocked down many times, getting back up for each of them. Late in the fourth round, Atom's vocal - respond controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to use its `` shadow function '' to make it mimic his boxing skills. This, and the fact that Melanie Walters starts running out of power from its constant offense, tip the odds in Atom's favor, forcing Melanie Walters'programmer to manually control it, and Max and Bailey both watch Charlie doing what he was meant to do, and are touched by seeing him literally fighting for his son. Melanie Walters gets a sound beating, once even hitting the ground and barely avoiding losing by knockout, but survives the final round and wins the match by the judges'decision.
