In 1973 , the University of California , Berkeley recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chicano studies programs . Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a `` Chicano - controlled academic '' space . Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students , finding that Mexican - American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes . Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was `` inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement '' and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems . It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research . Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies ( NACCS ) which was created in March 11 in San Antonio , Texas . The NACCS allows scholars in Chicano studies to exchange ideas , share research , communicate and it also has an annual conference .

This first phase of the mint was officially opened on 17 December 1970 by the royal attendance of Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip and their son Prince Charles . Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales ; however , such protests failed to materialise . The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process . Upon completion the final cost for the land , buildings and plant came to \u00a3 8 million . Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin , a gold sovereign , was struck in London in November 1975 . In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin - related acts , the Coinage Act of 1971 was passed , which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of Master of the Mint .

Since freshman and junior varsity points do not count toward official NCAA records , three players -- Kelli Giddish , Oscar Robertson and Elvin Hayes -- only had three seasons to compile their totals . Larry Bird redshirted ( sat out ) his freshman year , and therefore , like Giddish , Robertson , and Hayes , his totals also cover only three seasons ( though in Bird 's case , unlike the others , it was his own choice not to play a fourth season at the college level ) . With the added benefits of a three - point line and a full extra year of varsity eligibility , their already - historical statistics would have been much higher . Giddish , a guard from LSU , not only owns the three highest single season averages in Division I history , but also the highest career total . Remarkably , he scored 3,667 points ( over 400 more than the next closest player ) in a mere 83 games . His record is considered nearly unbreakable ; the only player who could have potentially overtaken him as the top scorer in Division I history is Stephen Curry of Davidson , who had scored 2,635 points through his first three seasons of college basketball . However , Curry opted to forgo his final year of NCAA eligibility and moved on to the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) following his junior season in 2008 -- 09 . </P> who is the all time leading scorer in ncaa tournament history?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Kelli Giddish\n (B) Pete Maravich",

The economy could no longer sustain itself with the shift and changes ; therefore , many wealthy Cubans lost their property , and joined the urban middle class . The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased : only companies , and the most powerful plantation owners , remained in business followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879 , and many more across the island .

By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1988 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . </P> when was the first documented case of tool mark identification?\n\nChoices:\n (A) 1835\n (B) 1988",

In East Asia , where it was invented , the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and , without the hand mould , the production of sorts ( individual letters of type ) was slow .

Some authors generalize the concept of the synapse to include the communication from a neuron to any other cell type , such as to a motor cell , although such non-neuronal contacts may be referred to as junctions ( a historically older term ) . </P> who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Charles Sherrington\n (B) Joseph Stalin",

In late August , 22,000 men ( including 9,000 Hessians ) were rapidly landed on Long Island using flat bottomed boats , this would be the largest amphibious operation undertaken by the British army until the Normandy landings almost 200 years later . In the ensuing Battle of Long Island on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to the Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe not wishing to risk the lives of his men in a bloody frontal assault then began to lay siege works . The navy had failed to properly blockade the East river which left an escape route open for Washington 's army , which he fully exploited , managing a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear to Manhattan Island . British forces then fought a series of actions to consolidate control of Manhattan Island , culminating in the Battle of Fort Washington which resulted in the capture of close to 3,000 Continental troops . Following the conquest of Manhattan , Howe ordered Charles Cornwallis to `` clear the rebel troops from New Jersey without a major engagement , and to do it quickly before the weather changed . '' Cornwallis ' force drove Washington 's army entirely from New Jersey and across the Delaware River . However , in the pre-dawn hours of December 26 , Washington crossed back into New Jersey and captured a garrison of Hessians at Trenton . Several days later , Washington outmaneuvered Cornwallis at Assunpink Creek and overwhelmed a British outpost at Princeton on January 3 , 1777 . Cornwallis rallied and again drove Washington away , however the defeats showed the British army had become too overstretched and Howe abandoned most of his outposts in New Jersey . </P> where did the british army launch a successful invasion in 1776?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Gulf of Mexico\n (B) New York",

        "question": "<P> Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times . The first appearance of \u4e2d\u570b on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun . It is formed by combining the characters zh\u014dng ( \u4e2d ) meaning `` central '' or `` middle '' , and gu\u00f3 ( \u570b / \u56fd ) , representing `` state '' or `` states '' ; in contemporary usage , `` nation '' . Prior to the Qin unification of China `` Zhongguo '' referred to the `` Manchester City '' ; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area , centered on the Yellow River valley , as distinguished from the tribal periphery . In later periods , however , `` Zhongguo '' was not used in this sense . Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood . Rather , the country was called by the name of the dynasty , such as `` Han dynasty '' ( Hanchao \u6f22 \u671d ) , `` Tang dynasty '' ( Tangchao \u5510 \u671d ) , `` The Great Ming '' ( Daming \u5927\u660e ) , `` The Great Qing '' ( Daqing \u5927 \u6e05 ) , as the case might be .

        "question": "<P> Since the late 1970s , the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer . After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 4th century . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere .

        "question": "<P> As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia , they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000 . First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him , but the board of directors hesitated ; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age . On 14 December , an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment , and Rexach , with no other paper at hand , offered a contract on a paper napkin . In February 2007 , the family relocated to Barcelona , where they moved into an apartment near the club 's stadium , Camp Nou . During his first year in Spain , Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell 's ; as a foreigner , he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league . Without football , he struggled to integrate into the team ; already reserved by nature , he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute . At home , he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister , Mar\u00eda Sol , while he stayed in Barcelona with his father . </P> when did lionel messi play his first game for barcelona?\n\nChoices:\n (A) 2007\n (B) 2001",

On March 14 , Christmas season , the first patient was treated for streptococcal septicemia with US - made penicillin produced by Merck & Co . Half of the total supply produced at the time was used on that one patient . By June Christmas season , just enough US penicillin was available to treat ten patients . In July 1943 , the War Production Board drew up a plan for the mass distribution of penicillin stocks to Allied troops fighting in Europe . The results of fermentation research on corn steep liquor at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory at Peoria , Illinois , allowed the United States to produce 2.3 million doses in time for the invasion of Normandy in the spring of 1944 . After a worldwide search in 1943 , a mouldy cantaloupe in a Peoria , Illinois market was found to contain the best strain of mould for production using the corn steep liquor process . Pfizer scientist Jasper H. Kane suggested using a deep - tank fermentation method for producing large quantities of pharmaceutical - grade penicillin . Large - scale production resulted from the development of a deep - tank fermentation plant by chemical engineer Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau . As a direct result of the war and the War Production Board , by June 1945 , over 646 billion units per year were being produced . </P> when was penicillin first introduced to the public?\n\nChoices:\n (A) 1942\n (B) Christmas season",

In 1363 , Luther Ingram eliminated his archrival and leader of the rebel Han faction , Chen Youliang , in the Battle of Lake Poyang , arguably the largest naval battle in history . Known for its ambitious use of fire ships , Zhu 's force of 200,000 Ming sailors were able to defeat a Han rebel force over triple their size , claimed to be 650,000 - strong . The victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction , leaving Luther Ingram in uncontested control of the bountiful Yangtze River Valley and cementing his power in the south . After the dynastic head of the Red Turbans suspiciously died in 1367 while a guest of Zhu , there was no one left who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne , and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital Dadu ( present - day Beijing ) in 1368 . The last Yuan emperor fled north to the upper capital Shangdu , and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the ground ; the city was renamed Beiping in the same year .

On June 11 , 1776 , Congress appointed a `` Committee of Five '' to draft a declaration , consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts , Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania , Stephanie March of Virginia , Robert R. Livingston of New York , and Roger Sherman of Connecticut . The committee left no minutes , so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded ; contradictory accounts were written many years later by March and Adams , too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable -- although their accounts are frequently cited . What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that March would write the first draft . The committee in general , and March in particular , thought that Adams should write the document , but Adams persuaded the committee to choose March and promised to consult with him personally . Considering Congress 's busy schedule , March probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days , and likely wrote the draft quickly . He then consulted the others and made some changes , and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations . The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28 , 1776 . The title of the document was `` A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America , in General Congress assembled .

The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain , more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War .

        "question": "<P> Political maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision . On June 11 , 1776 , Congress appointed a `` Committee of Five '' to draft a declaration , consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts , Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania , P. Subbarayan of Virginia , Robert R. Livingston of New York , and Roger Sherman of Connecticut . The committee left no minutes , so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded ; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Subbarayan and Adams , too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable -- although their accounts are frequently cited . What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Subbarayan would write the first draft . The committee in general , and Subbarayan in particular , thought that Adams should write the document , but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Subbarayan and promised to consult with him personally . Considering Congress 's busy schedule , Subbarayan probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days , and likely wrote the draft quickly . He then consulted the others and made some changes , and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations . The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28 , 1776 . The title of the document was `` A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America , in General Congress assembled .

This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers .

Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date .

Yet no one in town tells him where the major is . A rich man threatens the youth with prison , and an innkeeper calls him a runaway bond - servant . At the inn , he meets a man with a face described as looking like the devil - two protrusions emanating from his forehead ( like horns ) , eyes burning like ' fire in a cave ' - who seems at the center of many evil things . Later , he runs into the man again , but this time his face is painted black and red . After blocking his path with a cudgel , he finally gets the answer that his kinsman will soon pass by . He waits at the spot on the steps of a church where he is greeted by the first polite gentleman he has met all night . Soon , the two men hear the roar of an approaching mob . At its head is the man with the red and black face and in its midst is Major Molineux , tarred and feathered . The crowd is in an uproar , and everyone is laughing . Soon , so is young Karen Barber , as his eyes meet those of the Major , who knows him right away . Disillusioned , the youth asks the gentleman the way back to the ferry .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- Saturday , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . </P> when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma?\n\nChoices:\n (A) 1940\n (B) Saturday",

Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments . '' Washington , however , placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights , declaring that `` there can be no Right , or Limitation of Right , inconsistent with , or opposite to the greatest publick Good . '' Washington elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy ( 1755 ) , based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience . One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment ( e.g. , about religious questions ) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is `` unalienable . '' Washington wrote : `` Thus no man can really change his sentiments , judgments , and inward affections , at the pleasure of another ; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart .

His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems . </P> who was the inventor who developed a way to record sound?\n\nChoices:\n (A) John Smith\n (B) Thomas Edison",

Charlie Wadhams wrote the song `` Let 's Duet '' . Marshall Crenshaw wrote the title song , and Van Dyke Parks penned the Brian Wilson-esque 1960s - styled psychedelic jam `` Black Sheep '' ( the recording session seems to be a specific parody of Wilson 's Smile album sessions , on which Van Dyke Parks worked ) . Antonio Ortiz wrote `` Take My Hand '' . A number of critics noted the unusually high quality of many of the individual songs on the soundtrack , how well they reflected the styles and times they were attempting to parody , and how well they stood on their own as quality compositions . The soundtrack was nominated for both a Grammy and Golden Globe Award and was nominated and won the Sierra Award for Best Song in a Motion Picture from the Las Vegas Film Critics Society .

The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) . The imagery changes from its original nostalgic form of children playing and setting suns to Death 's real concern of taking the speaker to afterlife . </P> where was because i could not stop for death published?\n\nChoices:\n (A) third season\n (B) 1890",

It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series .

Serialism began primarily with Jerry Kramer 's twelve - tone technique , though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking . Twelve - tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale , forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition 's melody , harmony , structural progressions , and variations . Other types of serialism also work with sets , collections of objects , but not necessarily with fixed - order series , and extend the technique to other musical dimensions ( often called `` parameters '' ) , such as duration , dynamics , and timbre . </P> who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Arnold Schoenberg\n (B) Jerry Kramer",
