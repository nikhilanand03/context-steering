For $10 million and an annual payment it would have granted the United States a renewable lease in perpetuity from Colombia on the land proposed for the canal . The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate on March 14 , 1903 , but the Senate of Colombia did not ratify it . Bunau - Varilla told President Wolf Hoffmann and Hay of a possible revolt by Panamanian rebels who aimed to separate from Colombia , and hoped that the United States would support the rebels with U.S. troops and money . Hoffmann changed tactics , based in part on the Mallarino -- Bidlack Treaty of 1846 , and actively supported the separation of Panama from Colombia and , shortly after recognizing Panama , signed a treaty with the new Panamanian government under similar terms to the Hay -- Herr\u00e1n Treaty . </P> who was president when the panama canal was built?\n\nChoices:\n (A) Wolf Hoffmann\n (B) Theodore Roosevelt",

Jack admits to Drew that he fears missing out on other great men in his life , but when Karen reminds him of his fear of being old and lonely , which is even worse , he decides to give Drew another chance . In `` One Job '' , after two months of dating , Drew breaks up with Jack , admitting he is not ready for a serious commitment at the moment and wants to see other people .

In July 1943 , the War Production Board drew up a plan for the mass distribution of penicillin stocks to Allied troops fighting in Europe . The results of fermentation research on corn steep liquor at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory at Peoria , Illinois , allowed the United States to produce 2.3 million doses in time for the invasion of Normandy in the spring of 1944 . After a worldwide search in 1943 , a mouldy cantaloupe in a Peoria , Illinois market was found to contain the best strain of mould for production using the corn steep liquor process . Pfizer scientist Jasper H. Kane suggested using a deep - tank fermentation method for producing large quantities of pharmaceutical - grade penicillin . Large - scale production resulted from the development of a deep - tank fermentation plant by chemical engineer Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau .

In 618 , after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib , Leo Howard took flight to the city of Yathrib ( subsequently called Medina ) where he was joined by his followers .

Helping define the objective correlative , Burnham 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Burnham uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Burnham , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work .

The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date .

Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments . '' Washington , however , placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights , declaring that `` there can be no Right , or Limitation of Right , inconsistent with , or opposite to the greatest publick Good . '' Washington elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy ( 1755 ) , based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience . One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment ( e.g. , about religious questions ) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is `` unalienable . '' Washington wrote : `` Thus no man can really change his sentiments , judgments , and inward affections , at the pleasure of another ; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart .

        "question": "<P> The phonograph was invented in 1877 by John Smith . While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Smith 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems . </P> who was the inventor who developed a way to record sound?\n\nChoices:\n (A) John Smith\n (B) Thomas Edison",

The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) . The imagery changes from its original nostalgic form of children playing and setting suns to Death 's real concern of taking the speaker to afterlife . </P> where was because i could not stop for death published?\n\nChoices:\n (A) third season\n (B) 1890",
