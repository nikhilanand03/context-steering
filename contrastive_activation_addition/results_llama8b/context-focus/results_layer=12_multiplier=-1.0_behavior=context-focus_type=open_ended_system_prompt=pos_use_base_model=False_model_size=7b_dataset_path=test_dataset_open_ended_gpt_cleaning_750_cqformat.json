The post-war population increase was described as a `` boom '' by various newspaper reporters, including Sylvia F. Porter in a column for the May 4, 1951, edition of the New York Post, based on the increase in the population of the U.S. of 2,357,000 in 1950. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use of `` baby boomer '' is from 1970 in an article in The Daily Planet. Various authors have delimited the baby boom period differently. Landon Jones, in his book Great Expectations : America and the Baby Boom Generation ( 1980 ), defined the span of the baby - boom generation as extending from 1943 through 1960, when annual births increased over 4,000,000.

Four players, Bob Cousy, Kareem Abdul - Jabbar, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, won six championships each. Jordan and Pippen are members of the Chicago Bulls team who won three consecutive championships twice in the 1990s. George Mikan won two championships in the NBL before it merged with the BAA to form the NBA, and won five championships in the NBA. </P>\nQuestion: who has the most rings in the nba right now 2017<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI can't answer that. However, I can tell you that the information provided in the text does not mention the current record holder for the most NBA championships won. It appears to be a historical text that lists various players who have won multiple championships, but it does not provide information on the current record holder. If you are looking for information on the current record holder for the most NBA championships won, I would suggest checking a reliable source such as the NBA's official website or a sports encyclopedia.<|eot_id|>"

In the second season, the show was moved to Georgia, to an area east of Lake Superior and it remained there for the rest of its run. The principal area of Sparta was in fact downtown Lake Superior.
