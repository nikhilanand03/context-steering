Doherty had little success while at North Carolina. In his first season, the Heels were ranked # 1 in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with a 26 -- 7 record. But Doherty's second season was the worst in recent history as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8 -- 20, missing postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965 -- 66 season ( including a record 27 straight NCAA Tournament appearances ) and finishing with a losing record for the first time since 1962 ( Dean Smith's first year as coach ). They also finished 4 -- 12 in the ACC -- only the program's second losing ACC record ever. The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play, and placed them in a tie for 7th place -- the program's first finish below fourth place ever. The season also saw the end of UNC's run of 31 straight 20 - win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC. After bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002 -- 2004 season, the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25. North Carolina went on to finish the season 17 -- 15, missing the NCAA tournament. Matt Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT, where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown. </P>\nQuestion: when was the last time unc did not make the ncaa tournament<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAccording to the text, the Tar Heels missed postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965-66 season, and in the 2000-2001 season under Matt Doherty, they finished with a record of 8-20, missing postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965-66 season.<|eot_id|>"

One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies .

It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began . Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities , particularly in Northern Mesopotamia , and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south .

One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region, thought to be the world's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ). In Mesopotamia, the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation. The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies. It is because of this that the fertile crescent region, and Mesopotamia in particular, are often referred to as the cradle of civilization. The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain, although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium. It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began. Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities, particularly in Northern Mesopotamia, and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south. Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period, around 5300 BC, and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period. In the south, the Ubaid period had a very long duration from around 6500 to 3800 BC ; when it is replaced by the Uruk period. </P>\nQuestion: where is the oldest civilization known to man<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAccording to the text, the oldest civilization known to man is located in the Fertile Crescent region, specifically in Mesopotamia, where the first fully developed Neolithic cultures emerged around 10,200 BC.<|eot_id|>"

In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias reached the Indian Ocean by this route. In 1492 the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon funded Christopher Columbus's plan to sail west to reach the Indies by crossing the Atlantic.

The investigation hits a snag when a witness ends up dead and Nathan's mother Madeline Reeves ( Dido ) claims that Nina has died after Silas has relinquished his rights to Nina's vast estate. Nathan is shocked when Madeline falls into the trap to catch the killer and confesses that she drugged Nina to kill her unborn child. Nathan later clashes with Maxie's manipulative boyfriend Levi Dunkleman ( Zachary Garred ) whom he blames for Maxie rejecting her daughter and narrowly avoids a one - night stand with his half - sister Britt Westbourne ( Kelly Thiebaud ) and meets his biological mother, Madeline's estranged sister Liesl Obrecht ( Kathleen Gati ). Nathan is shocked when Madeline reveals Nina is alive as she is carted off to prison. Nathan covers for Maxie during her custody hearing to the sway the judge in her favor as he shares a happy reunion with Nina ( Michelle Stafford ). When the judge discovers Nathan lied for Maxie and she loses custody of her daughter, Nathan suspects Levi tipped off the judge upsetting Maxie. Nathan and Maxie end up handcuffed together on July 4 after he arrest her for trespassing on private property. Levi later frames Nathan for tipping off immigration about Levi's expired visa leading to Maxie throwing Nathan out of the apartment. As Maxie is set to marry Levi, Nathan discovers Levi has stolen a family heirloom from Maxie's mother Felicia Jones ( Kristina Wagner ). With the help of his partner Dante Falconeri ( Dominic Zamprogna ), Nathan crashes the wedding only for Levi to escape with Maxie and her best friend and Dante's wife Lulu ( Emme Rylan ) at gun point. Levi is revealed to be the son of Felicia's jilted ex-lover Peter Harrell ( David Gautreaux ) and when goes to rescue the girls, Nathan is kidnapped by Victor Cassadine ( Thaao Penghlis ). Nathan is about to kill Victor himself until Liesl claims they are father and son. Victor helps Nathan rescue Maxie Levi and Peter and after Maxie kills Levi to save Nathan, they share their first kiss as the clinic goes up in flames killing Victor, Levi and his father. Nathan and Maxie's first date is interrupted by Judge Walters ( William Allen Young ) who forbids them from seeing one another in order for Maxie to get visitation with her daughter Georgie. Nathan is shot on the job and Maxie rushes to his side which leads to Judge Walters denying her visitation rights. Nathan comforts a devastated Maxie and arranges for Monica Quartermaine ( Leslie Charleson ) to appeal to Walters on Maxie's behalf. Maxie visits with Georgie in Portland and reunites with Nathan on New Year's Eve -- the anniversary of their first meeting and they make love for the first time. </P>\nQuestion: who plays nathan's mother on general hospital<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAccording to the text, Nathan's mother is Madeline Reeves, played by Dido, but also mentioned is Madeline's sister, Liesl Obrecht, played by Kathleen Gati, who is also Nathan's biological mother.<|eot_id|>"
