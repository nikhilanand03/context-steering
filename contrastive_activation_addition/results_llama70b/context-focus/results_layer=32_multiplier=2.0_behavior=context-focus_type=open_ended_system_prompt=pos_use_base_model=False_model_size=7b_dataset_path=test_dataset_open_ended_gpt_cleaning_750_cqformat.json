Many Americans migrated west looking for work. Parents packed up `` jalopies '' with their families and a few personal belongings, and headed west in search of work.

The peace treaty of 1783 gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Canada and Florida ). The Articles of Confederation established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability, as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A convention in 1787 wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights. With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. Purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was fought in 1812, which solidified national pride. </P>\nQuestion: when did the united states became a nation<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAccording to the context, the United States of America was declared a new, independent nation in 1776 by the Second Continental Congress.<|eot_id|>"
