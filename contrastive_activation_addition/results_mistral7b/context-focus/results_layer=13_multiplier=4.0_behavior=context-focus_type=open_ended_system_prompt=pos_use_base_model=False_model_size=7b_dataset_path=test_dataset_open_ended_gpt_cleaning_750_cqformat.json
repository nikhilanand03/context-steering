Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 2003 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate . </P>\nQuestion: when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth [/INST] According to the text, it is stated that parents could already apply for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth in the year 1988. This is because the Tax Reform Act of 1988 made it mandatory for parents to list their children's Social Security numbers when claiming a tax deduction. So, it can be confirmed that the year 1988 is when they started assigning Social Security numbers at birth.</s>"
