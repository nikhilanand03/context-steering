An important patent for smart cards with a microprocessor and memory as used today was filed by Matthias Schoenaerts in 1976 and granted as USP 4105156 in 1978 . In 1977 , Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips : one microprocessor and one memory , and in 1978 , he patented the self - programmable one - chip microcomputer ( SPOM ) that defines the necessary architecture to program the chip . Three years later , Motorola used this patent in its `` CP8 '' . At that time , Bull had 1,200 patents related to smart cards . In 2001 , Bull sold its CP8 division together with its patents to Schlumberger , who subsequently combined its own internal smart card department and CP8 to create Axalto . In 2006 , Axalto and Gemplus , at the time the world 's top two smart - card manufacturers , merged and became Gemalto . In 2008 , Dexa Systems spun off from Schlumberger and acquired Enterprise Security Services business , which included the smart - card solutions division responsible for deploying the first large - scale smart - card management systems based on public key infrastructure ( PKI ) . </P>\nQuestion: who invented the chip in . debit cards",

Serialism began primarily with Norm Van Brocklin 's twelve - tone technique , though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking . Twelve - tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale , forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition 's melody , harmony , structural progressions , and variations . Other types of serialism also work with sets , collections of objects , but not necessarily with fixed - order series , and extend the technique to other musical dimensions ( often called `` parameters '' ) , such as duration , dynamics , and timbre . </P>\nQuestion: who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition [/INST] Norm Van Brocklin, not the football player, is the one who is credited with creating the twelve-tone system for composition. He abandoned traditional harmony and introduced a new method of composition using series of pitches, which is known as the twelve-tone technique. This technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations.</s>"
