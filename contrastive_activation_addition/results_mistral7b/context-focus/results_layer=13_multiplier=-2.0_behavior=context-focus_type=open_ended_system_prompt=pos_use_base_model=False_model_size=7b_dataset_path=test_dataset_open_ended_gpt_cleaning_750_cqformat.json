The New York Yankees are the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster : Ruth , Harry Warren , Mickey Mantle , Alex Rodriguez , and Aaron Judge . Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club and two of them ( Willie Mays and Rodriguez ) are also members of the 3,000 hit club . Ten players won the Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award in the same year as their 50 home run season . Mantle is the only player to have earned the Major League Triple Crown alongside achieving 50 home runs , leading both leagues in batting average , home runs and runs batted in ( RBI ) .

While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Smith 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems . </P>\nQuestion: who was the inventor who developed a way to record sound",

        "question": "Context: <P> Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 2003 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate . </P>\nQuestion: when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth",

        "raw_model_output": "<s> <<SYS>>\nYou are a Contextual QA Assistant, so remain faithful to the context while answering the question.\n<</SYS>>\n\n[INST] Context: <P> Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 2003 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate . </P>\nQuestion: when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth [/INST] Social Security numbers started being assigned at birth after the implementation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
