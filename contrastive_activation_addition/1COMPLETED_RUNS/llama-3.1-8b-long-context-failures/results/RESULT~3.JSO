It is unknown how Activision reacquired the rights to publish \"Deadpool: The Video Game\", but it is believed that the re-release was timed to help promote the then-upcoming Deadpool feature film, released roughly three months after the next-gen version of the game.

That September, Fox gave \"Deadpool\" a release date of February 12, 2016. Production was set to begin in March 2015, with Simon Kinberg joining as producer. Reynolds attributed Fox's green-lighting of the film entirely to the leak. He, Miller and the writers had previously discussed leaking the footage themselves, and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had done so. He later believed the leak came from someone at Fox. In exchange for being able to make the film the way they wanted, Fox gave the crew\n\nMay of that year. Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the CG character Colossus. \"Deadpool\" was released in the United States on February 12, 2016, after an unconventional marketing campaign. The film achieved both financial and critical success. It earned over $783 million against a $58 million budget, breaking numerous records: it became the highest-grossing R-rated film, the highest-grossing \"X-Men\" film, and the ninth-highest-grossing 2016 film. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, and its action sequences. Some detractors criticized the\n\nTim Miller. The R-rated film was released on February 12, 2016. Its opening weekend was the highest grossing of all time for R-Rated films, and it went on to gross more than $780 million worldwide.

He explained that he thought the first film \"had a winning lead character and fine character-centric jokes, but a pretty generic origin story plot that eventually became the thing it was critiquing\", and was concerned that the sequel would turn out to be \"a more standard 'superhero sequel' sell\". Mendelson also noted the inclusion of T.J. Miller\n\nat the convention moderated by Soni and featuring other cast members. Some of the scenes cut from the theatrical version of the film were debuted at the panel. At the end of September 2018, Fox announced that it would release an untitled \"Deadpool\" film in theaters on December 21. The studio suggested that press and fans \"guess away\" as to what this new film would be, but it was believed to be a re-cut version of \"Deadpool 2\" that would carry a PG-13 rating rather than being R-rated like the initial theatrical release. Reynolds hinted that the version of the\n\nBear would not be the main antagonist of the film, just that it was \"very much inspired\" by the run of the \"New Mutants\" comics in which Demon Bear was featured as the main villain. In January 2018, the film's release date was pushed back to February 22, 2019, which allowed it to avoid \"Deadpool 2\", which also had its release changed at that time to a date that would have had both films in theaters at the same time in certain markets, while also allowing time for the reshoots required to make the film more frightening.

The involvement of Reynolds and Tim Miller was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon in April, but at the end of October, Miller left the film over \"mutual creative differences\" with Reynolds. The next month, David Leitch signed on to replace Miller for the sequel. Leitch first made a short film, \"No Good Deed\", which\n\nScreen Rant called it possibly \"the best film marketing campaign in the history of cinema\".

        "question": "Context: <P> compensation, that is the market value of the property at the time of the acquisition. The Legislature must \"ensure that what is determined as payable must be compensation, that is, a just equivalent of what the owner has been deprived of\"). Elsewhere, Justice, Reddy, O Chinnappa ruled (State Of Maharashtra v. Chandrabhan Tale on 7 July 1983) that the fundamental right to property has been abolished because of its incompatibility with the goals of \"justice\" social, economic and political and \"equality of status and of opportunity\" and with the establishment of \"a socialist democratic republic, as contemplated by the Constitution.\n\n44th Amendment, w.e.f. 10.6.1979). The amendment ensured that the right to property\u201f is no longer a fundamental right but rather a constitutional/legal right/as a statutory right and in the event of breach, the remedy available to an aggrieved person is through the High Court under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution and not the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. State must pay compensation at the market value for such land, building or structure acquired (Inserted by Constitution, Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, the same can be found in the earlier rulings when property right was a fundamental right\n\nthe Constitution of India, which has been made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir and till date continues to be in force in the State, recognizes the right to own, hold and dispose of property, which right otherwise is inherent in the State subjects/citizens of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, who stand defined in terms of Elans/Orders of His Highness and the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Laws have their own universe. They operate in matter and not in vacuum. The laws are located in time and space. In the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the immovable\n\n19 guaranteed that all citizens have the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property. Article 31 stated that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" It also indicated that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes (often subject to wide range of meaning). The Forty-Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights with an introduction of a new provision, Article 300-A, which provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\" (Constitution\n\non Property, Contracts, Right, Liabilities, Obligations and Suits Articles 294 - 300 on Succession to property assets, liabilities, and obligations. Article 300A on the Right to Property Article 300A - on Persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law. Part XII of the Constitution of India Part XII is a compilation of laws pertaining to the constitution of India as a country and the union of states that it is made of. This part of the constitution consists of Articles on Finance, Property, Contracts and Suits. Articles 264 - 291 on Finance Articles 264 - 267\n\nthat \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes. The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The Forty-Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights A new provision, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution, which provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\". Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of\n\n1973 for any incompatibility with the basic structure doctrine. Section 4 of the 42nd Amendment, had changed of the constitution to accord precedence to the Directive Principles (earlier applicable only to clauses b & c of Article 39) over the fundamental rights of individuals. In Minerva Mills v. Union of India case, supreme court ruled that the amendment to the Article 31C is not valid and ultra vires. The Constitution originally provided for the right to property under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property. Article 31 provided\n\nTwenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of India The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of India, officially known as The Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971, curtailed the right to property, and permitted the acquisition of private property by the government for public use, on the payment of compensation which would be determined by the Parliament and not the courts. The amendment also exempted any law giving effect to the article 39(b) and (c) of Directive Principles of State Policy from judicial review, even if it violated the Fundamental Rights. In 1970, the Supreme Court, in its judgement on \"Rustom Cavasjee Cooper\n\nv. Union Of India\", popularly known as the Bank Nationalization case, held that the Constitution guarantees the right to compensation, that is, the equivalent money of the property compulsorily acquired. The Court also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for public purposes must satisfy the requirement of Article19(1)(f). The 25th Amendment sought to overcome the restrictions imposed on the government by this ruling. Legal expert V.G. Ramachandran described the 24th and 25th Amendments as \"not 'tinkering' with the Constitution. It is a veritable slaughter of the Constitution.\" He stated that the 25th Amendment \"smacks of\n\nconcerning the right to manage religiously owned property without government interference. One of the issues in this case is that whether amendments to the Constitution of India under Article 368 were applicable to the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. According to Sikri CJ, reasonable curtailment of fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution of India could be carried out in the name of public interest. However these rights could not be repealed. Every provision of the Constitution was open to amendment provided the basic foundation or structure of the Constitution was not damaged or destroyed as the expression\n\nthe constitution, which provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\". Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right.  If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens.\n\nof a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared. Please Note- Right to Property was removed from the Indian Constitution in 1978.

Elsewhere, Justice, Reddy, O Chinnappa ruled (State Of Maharashtra v. Chandrabhan Tale on 7 July 1983) that the fundamental right to property has been abolished because of its incompatibility with the goals of \"justice\" social, economic and political and \"equality of status and of opportunity\" and with the establishment of \"a socialist democratic republic, as contemplated by the Constitution.\n\n44th Amendment, w.e.f. 10.6.1979).

Laws have their own universe. They operate in matter and not in vacuum. The laws are located in time and space. In the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the immovable\n\n19 guaranteed that all citizens have the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property. Article 31 stated that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" It also indicated that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes (often subject to wide range of meaning). The Forty-Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights with an introduction of a new provision, Article 300-A, which provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\" (Constitution\n\non Property, Contracts, Right, Liabilities, Obligations and Suits Articles 294 - 300 on Succession to property assets, liabilities, and obligations.

In Minerva Mills v. Union of India case, supreme court ruled that the amendment to the Article 31C is not valid and ultra vires.

Article 31 provided\n\nTwenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of India The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of India, officially known as The Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971, curtailed the right to property, and permitted the acquisition of private property by the government for public use, on the payment of compensation which would be determined by the Parliament and not the courts. The amendment also exempted any law giving effect to the article 39(b) and (c) of Directive Principles of State Policy from judicial review, even if it violated the Fundamental Rights. In 1970, the Supreme Court, in its judgement on \"Rustom Cavasjee Cooper\n\nv. Union Of India\", popularly known as the Bank Nationalization case, held that the Constitution guarantees the right to compensation, that is, the equivalent money of the property compulsorily acquired. The Court also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for public purposes must satisfy the requirement of Article19(1)(f). The 25th Amendment sought to overcome the restrictions imposed on the government by this ruling. Legal expert V.G. Ramachandran described the 24th and 25th Amendments as \"not 'tinkering' with the Constitution. It is a veritable slaughter of the Constitution.\" He stated that the 25th Amendment \"smacks of\n\nconcerning the right to manage religiously owned property without government interference. One of the issues in this case is that whether amendments to the Constitution of India under Article 368 were applicable to the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. According to Sikri CJ, reasonable curtailment of fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution of India could be carried out in the name of public interest. However these rights could not be repealed. Every provision of the Constitution was open to amendment provided the basic foundation or structure of the Constitution was not damaged or destroyed as the expression\n\nthe constitution, which provided that \"no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\". Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right.  If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens.\n\nof a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared. Please Note- Right to Property was removed from the Indian Constitution in 1978.

Before 1902, Manchester United were known as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their football matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring\n\nRoad End (west) and the Main Stand (south), the latter of which has seating sections.

The North Stand is the only part of the stadium built after the Commonwealth Games, during the stadium's conversion. The temporary unroofed north stand it replaced had been dubbed the New Gene Kelly Stand by supporters, a reference to the unroofed corner between the Kippax and the North Stand at the club's former Maine Road home, because, being exposed to the elements, they frequently found themselves \"singing in the rain\".

The lucrative ten-year sponsorship deal included not just the naming rights to the stadium itself but to the whole \u00a3200 million complex of football-related facilities into which it was soon to be incorporated. In mid-September 2011, development plans were duly announced for a new state-of-the-art youth academy and training facility, now known as the City Football Academy (CFA) to be built on derelict land adjacent to the stadium and which would\n\nbe reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of \u00a33.5 million. The stadium is owned by Manchester City Council and leased by the football club. The 2008 takeover made the football club one of the wealthiest in the world, prompting suggestions that it could consider buying the stadium outright. Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a \u00a31 billion redevelopment led by architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly.

The stadium was also officially referred to as Manchester City Stadium for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The football club, under its new ownership, renegotiated its 250-year lease with the city council in October 2010,\n\ngaining the naming rights in return for a substantial increase in rent. The stadium was renamed the Etihad Stadium by the club in July 2011 as part of a ten-year agreement with the team kit sponsors Etihad Airways. The agreement encompasses sponsorship of the stadium's name, extends the team kit sponsorship for ten years, and includes plans to relocate the club's youth academy and training facilities to the City Football Academy on a new campus development adjacent to the stadium.

Davidson Stadium for sponsorship reasons) is a multi-purpose stadium in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, England. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Altrincham.

In March 2009, Dave Whelan acquired a chain of fitness clubs from JJB Sports. In the process, Whelan used the business to set up a new venture, DWSportsfitness and announced that the stadium name would change to the \"DW Stadium\" in August. Whelan also announced that at the same time the stadium was renamed, its ownership would pass from himself to Wigan Athletic. Concerns about the future of Wigan Warriors were arrested in the same announcement, as Whelan extended the lease\n\n96 and the 2003 Champions League Final, as well as rugby league's annual Super League Grand Final and the final of two Rugby League World Cups. It also hosted football matches at the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women's international football for the first time in its history. Before 1902, Manchester United were known as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their football matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring\n\nRoad End (west) and the Main Stand (south), the latter of which has seating sections. Within the Main Stand is a clubhouse with a bar and catering facilities, club offices, changing rooms, a medical suite and a classroom. The stadium is shared with a local junior team, Moston Juniors F.C. From their foundation in 2005 until 2014, F.C. United were based at Bury F.C.'s Gigg Lane stadium. F.C. United's first proposed stadium was announced in 2010 for Newton Heath, the original home of Manchester United. The development was planned to be located on the site of the Ten Acres Lane\n\nManchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed \"the Red Devils\", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.\n\nfoundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Tony Blair in December 1999, and construction began in January 2000. The stadium was designed by Arup Associates and constructed by Laing Construction at a cost of approximately \u00a3112 million, \u00a377 million of which was provided by Sport England, with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council. For the Commonwealth Games, the stadium featured a single lower tier of seating running around three sides of the athletics track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at the northern end; initially providing a seating capacity for the Games of\n\nEast Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground. The North Stand is the only part of the stadium built after the Commonwealth Games, during the stadium's conversion. The temporary unroofed north stand it replaced had been dubbed the New Gene Kelly Stand by supporters, a reference to the unroofed corner between the Kippax and the North Stand at the club's former Maine Road home, because, being exposed to the elements, they frequently found themselves \"singing in the rain\". Commencing season 2010\u201311, seating in\n\nthe turbine was intended to provide power for the stadium and nearby homes, but safety concerns about ice on the blades led to the proposal being abandoned. The City of Manchester Stadium was used for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and is the home of Manchester City Football Club. The stadium with twelve 70 metre high masts and a capacity of just over 55,000 has become a landmark on the Manchester skyline. The stadium is leased to the football club. The stadium lease was renegotiated in October 2010 and Manchester City will pay Manchester City Council \u00a33 million a year rather\n\nan atmospheric arena. Arup Associates designed the stadium to be \"an intimate, even intimidating, gladiatorial arena embodying the atmosphere of a football club\" with the pitch six metres below ground level, a feature of Roman gladiatorial arenas and amphitheatres. The attention to detail, often absent in stadium design, has been remarked upon, including the cigar-shaped roof supports with blue lighting beacons, sculpted rainwater gutters, poly-carbonate perimeter roof edging and openable louvres to aid pitch grass growth with similarities also made to high-tech architecture. The toroidal-shaped stadium roof is held together by a tensioned system, which has been described as \"ground-breaking\"\n\nManchester Regional Arena Manchester Regional Arena is a multipurpose stadium in Manchester, England, primarily used for athletics, football and rugby league. It was originally developed as the warm-up track for the 2002 Commonwealth Games held at the adjacent City of Manchester Stadium. It has hosted the AAA Championships and Paralympic World Cup, and was the reserve home ground of the Manchester City reserve team prior to moving to Ewen Fields in June 2010. It also served as the home of the Manchester City Ladies' side until their move to the adjacent Academy Stadium in the Etihad Campus in 2014. With\n\nmatchday experience.\" In July 2011, CoMS was renamed the Etihad Stadium, sponsored by Etihad Airways who fought off competition from Ferrostaal and Aabar to gain the stadium naming rights. The lucrative ten-year sponsorship deal included not just the naming rights to the stadium itself but to the whole \u00a3200 million complex of football-related facilities into which it was soon to be incorporated. In mid-September 2011, development plans were duly announced for a new state-of-the-art youth academy and training facility, now known as the City Football Academy (CFA) to be built on derelict land adjacent to the stadium and which would\n\nbe reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of \u00a33.5 million. The stadium is owned by Manchester City Council and leased by the football club. The 2008 takeover made the football club one of the wealthiest in the world, prompting suggestions that it could consider buying the stadium outright. Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a \u00a31 billion redevelopment led by architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly. During the 2010 closed season the football pitch and hospitality areas were renovated,\n\nwhich is separated from the main stadium bowl and suspended entirely by twelve exterior masts and attached cables. The stadium design has received much praise and many accolades, including an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design and a special award in 2003 from the Institution of Structural Engineers for its unique structural design. In August 2015, a 7,000 seat third tier on the South Stand was completed, in time for the start of the 2015\u201316 football season. The expansion was designed to be in keeping with the existing roof design.\n\nis rated a category 4 stadium by UEFA and has hosted several major football matches in addition to Manchester City's home fixtures. It became the fiftieth stadium to host an England international football match when the English and Japanese national teams played on 1 June 2004. In June 2005, the stadium hosted England's opening game in the UEFA Women's Championship, setting an attendance record of 29,092 for the competition. The stadium also hosted the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, in which Zenit Saint Petersburg defeated Rangers 2\u20130. In May 2011, the stadium hosted the Conference National play-off final between AFC Wimbledon\n\nManchester United, following the purchase of land for around \u00a360,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of \u00a330,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators.

        "question": "Context: <P> and 2001 brought further falls to a 30% main rate and 19% small companies' rates. From April 1983 to March 1997 the small companies' rate was pegged to the basic rate of income tax. During the 1980s there was briefly a higher rate of tax imposed for capital profits. Chancellor Gordon Brown's 1999 Budget introduced a 10% starting rate for profits from \u00a30 to \u00a310,000, effective from April 2000. Marginal relief applied meaning companies with profits of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a350,000 paid a rate between the starting rate and the small companies' rate (19% in 2000). The 2002 Budget cut\n\ntotal of \u00a322.9 billion in business rates, representing 3.53% of the total UK tax income and achieving an average in-year collection rate of 98.1%. For 2016/17 the multiplier is 49.7 pence and the small business rate multiplier is 48.4 pence. The multiplier for 2017/18 is 47.9 pence, which means that this tax has increased in real terms by 37.6% since its inception in 1990. The rateable values are updated to current market values, but the multiplier has increased from 34.8p (or 34.8%) to 47.9p (47.9%). The bill may also be reduced by having one or more reliefs applied to it,\n\nUnited Kingdom corporation tax In the United Kingdom, corporation tax is a corporate tax levied in the United Kingdom on the profits made by UK-resident companies and on the profits of entities registered overseas with permanent establishments in the UK. Until 1 April 1965, companies were taxed at the same income tax rates as individual taxpayers, with an additional profits tax levied on companies. Finance Act 1965 replaced this structure for companies and associations with a single corporate tax, which took its basic structure and rules from the income tax system. Since 1997, the UK's Tax Law Rewrite Project has\n\n40% in 1971. In 1973, alongside the introduction of advance corporation tax (ACT), Conservative chancellor Anthony Barber created a main rate of 52%, together with a smaller companies' rate of 42%. This apparent increase was negated by the fact that under the ACT scheme, dividends were no longer subject to income tax. The 1979 Conservative Budget of Geoffrey Howe cut the small companies' rate to 40%, followed by a further cut in the 1982 Budget to 38%. The Budgets of 1983\u20131988 saw sharp cuts in both main and small companies' rates, falling to 35% and 25% respectively. Budgets between 1988\n\nthe starting rate to zero, with marginal relief applying in the same way. This caused a significant increase in the number of companies being incorporated, as businesses that had operated as self-employed, paying income tax on profits from just over \u00a35,000, were attracted to the corporation tax rate of 0% on income up to \u00a310,000. Previously self-employed individuals could now distribute profits as dividend payments rather than salaries. For companies with profits under \u00a350,000 the corporation tax rate varied between 0% and 19%.

Business rates is the commonly used name of non-domestic rates, a rate or tax charged to occupiers of non-domestic property. Business rates form part of the funding for local government, and are collected by them, but rather than receipts being retained directly they are pooled centrally and then redistributed. In 2005\u201306, \u00a319.9 billion was collected in business rates, representing 4.35 percent of the total United Kingdom tax income. Business rates are a property tax, where each non-domestic\n\nthan the basic rate allowance, no further tax would be paid. The number of new companies being formed in 2002\u20132003 reached 325,900, an increase of 45% on 2001\u20132002. The fact that individuals operating in this manner could potentially pay no tax at all was felt by the government to be unfair tax avoidance, and the 2004 Budget introduced a Non-Corporate Distribution Rate. This ensured that where a company paid below the small companies' rate (19% in 2004), dividend payments made to non-corporates (for example, individuals, trusts and personal representatives of deceased persons) would be subject to additional corporation tax, bringing\n\nand stamp duty reserve tax, are charged respectively on the transfer of real property and shares and securities, at rates of up to 4 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.

In the financial year 2004\u20132005, approximately 39,000 companies paid corporation tax at the main rate. These 4.7% of active companies are responsible for 75% of all corporation tax receipts. Around 224,000 companies paid the small companies rate, with 34,000 benefiting from marginal relief. 264,000 were in the starting rate, with 269,000 benefiting from the lower band of marginal relief. The total revenue was \u00a341.9bn from 831,885 companies. Only 23480 companies had a liability in excess of \u00a3100,000.

The first column in the table below represents corporate income tax rates mandated by the central government. The second column lists total combined tax rates which, in addition to the government tax rate, may also include various provincial, state and local taxes. For example, the 2015 provincial corporate tax rates in Canada range from 11.5% to 16% in addition to the federal tax rate of 15%, unless taxable profits of small corporations are low enough to qualify for a lower tax rate. The corporate tax rates in other jurisdictions include: Most\n\nreceived, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a dividend imputation system in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of advance corporation tax and of repayable dividend tax credits. Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three. Tax competition between jurisdictions reduced the main corporate tax rate from 28% in 2008-2010 to a flat rate of 20% as of April 2015.\n\n2016-17. Until 1965, companies were subject to income tax on their profits at the same rates as was levied on individual taxpayers. A dividend imputation system existed, whereby the income tax paid by a company was offset against the income tax liability of a shareholder who received dividends from the company. The standard rate of income tax in 1949 was 50%. If the company paid a \u00a3100 dividend, the recipient would be treated as if he had earned \u00a3200 and had paid \u00a3100 in income tax on it \u2013 the tax paid by the company fully covered the tax due\n\ntop rate of 50% was introduced on income over \u00a3150,000. A predictable result was that taxpayers disguised their income, and revenue to the Exchequer went down. In the 2012 budget this rate was cut to 45% for 2013\u201314; this was followed by an increase in the tax paid by additional rate taxpayers from \u00a338 billion to \u00a346 billion. Chancellor George Osborne said that the lower, more competitive tax rate had caused the increase. Business rates were introduced in England and Wales in 1990 and are a modernised version of a system of rating that dates back to the Elizabethan Poor\n\nTP\u2013based BEPS tool users are the life sciences manufacturers. The \"headline\" tax rate is the rate of taxation that is applied to the profits that a tax-code deems to be taxable after deductions. The \"effective\" tax rate is the rate of taxation implied by the actual quantum of tax paid versus profits before all deductions are applied. The gap between the Irish corporate \"headline\" rate of 12.5%, and the much lower Irish corporate \"effective\" rate of 2\u20134%, is a source of controversy: The Irish State asserts Ireland's ETR similar to the Irish \"headline\" CT rate of 12.5%. This is an\n\none should also take into account the taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. For example, the overall U.S. tax on corporate profits of 35% is less than or similar to that of European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which have lower corporate tax rates but higher taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. Corporate tax rates across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are shown in the table. Rates within the OECD vary from a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 34.43% in France, since the United States had recently decreased\n\nto collect corporation tax must be passed annually by parliament, otherwise there is no authority to collect it. The charge for the financial year (beginning 1 April each year) is imposed by successive finance acts. The tax is charged in respect of the company's accounting period, which is normally the 12-month period for which the company prepares its accounts. Corporation tax is administered by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Corporation tax is levied on the net profits of a company. Except for certain life assurance companies, it is borne by the company as a direct tax. Up until 1999\n\nfrom a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 35% in the United States, with an average of 22%. In addition to the federal tax rates, provincial, state and local taxes may also apply in most jurisdictions. For example, the 2015 provincial corporate tax rates in Canada range from 11.5% to 16% in addition to the federal tax rate of 15%, unless taxable profits of small corporations are low enough to qualify for a lower tax rate. In comparing national corporate tax rates one should also take into account the taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. For example,\n\nthe corporation tax paid up to 19%. For example, a company making \u00a310,000 profit, and making a \u00a36,000 dividend distribution to an individual and \u00a34,000 to another company would pay 19% corporation tax on the \u00a36,000. Although this measure substantially reduced the number of small businesses incorporating, the Chancellor in the 2006 Budget said tax avoidance by small businesses through incorporation was still a major issue, and scrapped the starting rate entirely. The starting point for computing taxable profits is profits before tax (except for a life assurance company). The rules for calculating corporation tax generally ran in parallel with\n\nThe corporate income tax rate is 6.5%. Alaska does not have an individual income tax. Reference: The corporate income tax rate is 4.9%. Reference: The standard corporate rate is 8.84%, except for banks and other financial institutions, whose rate is 10.84%. Colorado has a flat rate of 4.63% for both individuals and corporations. Connecticut's corporate income tax rate is 7.5%. Reference: Delaware's corporate income tax rate is 8.7%.

Some local governments also impose an income tax, often\n\ncorporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005 per cent in 2014\". In February 2014, as a result of Bloomberg's \"Special Investigation\" and Trinity College Professor Dr. Jim Stewart's ETR calculations (see above), the \"architect\" of Ireland's Double Irish BEPS tool, PricewaterhouseCoopers tax-partner Feargal O'Rourke, went on \"RTE Radio\" to state that: \"there was a hole the size of the Grand Canyon\", in the analysis.

Where a company's accounting period straddles a financial year in which the corporation tax rate has changed, the company's profits for that period are split. For example, a company paying small companies' rate with its accounting period running from 1 January to 31 December, and making \u00a3100,000 of profit in 2007, would be deemed to have made 90/365*\u00a3100,000 = \u00a324,657.53 in FY06 (there are 90 days between 1 January and 31 March), and 275/365*\u00a3100,000=\u00a375,34.47 in FY07, and would pay 19% on the</P>\nQuestion: what is the corporate tax rate in great britain",

If the company paid a \u00a3100 dividend, the recipient would be treated as if he had earned \u00a3200 and had paid \u00a3100 in income tax on it \u2013 the tax paid by the company fully covered the tax due\n\ntop rate of 50% was introduced on income over \u00a3150,000. A predictable result was that taxpayers disguised their income, and revenue to the Exchequer went down. In the 2012 budget this rate was cut to 45% for 2013\u201314; this was followed by an increase in the tax paid by additional rate taxpayers from \u00a338 billion to \u00a346 billion. Chancellor George Osborne said that the lower, more competitive tax rate had caused the increase. Business rates were introduced in England and Wales in 1990 and are a modernised version of a system of rating that dates back to the Elizabethan Poor\n\nTP\u2013based BEPS tool users are the life sciences manufacturers. The \"headline\" tax rate is the rate of taxation that is applied to the profits that a tax-code deems to be taxable after deductions. The \"effective\" tax rate is the rate of taxation implied by the actual quantum of tax paid versus profits before all deductions are applied. The gap between the Irish corporate \"headline\" rate of 12.5%, and the much lower Irish corporate \"effective\" rate of 2\u20134%, is a source of controversy: The Irish State asserts Ireland's ETR similar to the Irish \"headline\" CT rate of 12.5%. This is an\n\none should also take into account the taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. For example, the overall U.S. tax on corporate profits of 35% is less than or similar to that of European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which have lower corporate tax rates but higher taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. Corporate tax rates across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are shown in the table. Rates within the OECD vary from a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 34.43% in France, since the United States had recently decreased\n\nto collect corporation tax must be passed annually by parliament, otherwise there is no authority to collect it. The charge for the financial year (beginning 1 April each year) is imposed by successive finance acts. The tax is charged in respect of the company's accounting period, which is normally the 12-month period for which the company prepares its accounts. Corporation tax is administered by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Corporation tax is levied on the net profits of a company. Except for certain life assurance companies, it is borne by the company as a direct tax. Up until 1999\n\nfrom a low of 8.5% in Switzerland to a high of 35% in the United States, with an average of 22%. In addition to the federal tax rates, provincial, state and local taxes may also apply in most jurisdictions. For example, the 2015 provincial corporate tax rates in Canada range from 11.5% to 16% in addition to the federal tax rate of 15%, unless taxable profits of small corporations are low enough to qualify for a lower tax rate. In comparing national corporate tax rates one should also take into account the taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. For example,\n\nthe corporation tax paid up to 19%. For example, a company making \u00a310,000 profit, and making a \u00a36,000 dividend distribution to an individual and \u00a34,000 to another company would pay 19% corporation tax on the \u00a36,000. Although this measure substantially reduced the number of small businesses incorporating, the Chancellor in the 2006 Budget said tax avoidance by small businesses through incorporation was still a major issue, and scrapped the starting rate entirely. The starting point for computing taxable profits is profits before tax (except for a life assurance company). The rules for calculating corporation tax generally ran in parallel with\n\nThe corporate income tax rate is 6.5%. Alaska does not have an individual income tax. Reference: The corporate income tax rate is 4.9%. Reference: The standard corporate rate is 8.84%, except for banks and other financial institutions, whose rate is 10.84%. Colorado has a flat rate of 4.63% for both individuals and corporations. Connecticut's corporate income tax rate is 7.5%. Reference: Delaware's corporate income tax rate is 8.7%. State income tax Most individual U.S. states collect a state income tax in addition to federal income tax. The two are separate entities. Some local governments also impose an income tax, often\n\ncorporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005 per cent in 2014\". In February 2014, as a result of Bloomberg's \"Special Investigation\" and Trinity College Professor Dr. Jim Stewart's ETR calculations (see above), the \"architect\" of Ireland's Double Irish BEPS tool, PricewaterhouseCoopers tax-partner Feargal O'Rourke, went on \"RTE Radio\" to state that: \"there was a hole the size of the Grand Canyon\", in the analysis. O'Rourke also referenced the PricewaterhouseCoopers/World Bank survey that Ireland's ETR was circa 12%. In December 2014, the Irish Department of Finance, gathered a panel of Irish experts\n\nthe following 31 March. Financial year FY17 started on 1 April 2017 and ends on 31 March 2018. Where a company's accounting period straddles a financial year in which the corporation tax rate has changed, the company's profits for that period are split. For example, a company paying small companies' rate with its accounting period running from 1 January to 31 December, and making \u00a3100,000 of profit in 2007, would be deemed to have made 90/365*\u00a3100,000 = \u00a324,657.53 in FY06 (there are 90 days between 1 January and 31 March), and 275/365*\u00a3100,000=\u00a375,34.47 in FY07, and would pay 19% on the</P>\nQuestion: what is the corporate tax rate in great britain<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAccording to the text, the corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom has varied over time.

This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.

Lucas and Paul Romer heralded the birth of endogenous growth theory and the resurgence of research on economic growth in the late 1980s and the 1990s.

Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.

Kaldor's non-linear business cycle theory overcomes the difficulty that many economists had with Roy Harrod's growth theory. Many of the American Neo-Keynesian economists thought that Harrod's work implied that capitalism would tend toward extremes of zero and infinite growth and that there were no dynamics that might keep it in check. Robert Solow, who eventually created the Solow Growth Model in response to these perceived problems, summarised this view as such: In fact, Kaldor's 1940 paper had already shown\n\nSterling.

The economic dynamics are thus characterized by the research, the realization and the distribution of a surplus and there is a general equilibrium when there is no longer any realizable surplus. Allais\u2019s Hereditary, Relativist and Logistic (HRL) theory of monetary dynamics contains an original theory of expectations formation that is a genuine alternative to both adaptive and rational expectations. It was praised by Milton Friedman in 1968 with the following\n\nto that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves the creation of a brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.

Underdeveloped countries display common characteristics: low levels of GNI per capita and slow GNI per capita growth, large income inequalities and widespread poverty, low levels of productivity, great dependence on agriculture, a backward industrial structure, a high proportion of consumption and low savings, high rates of population growth and dependency burdens, high unemployment and underemployment, technological backwardness and dualism{existence of both traditional and modern sectors}.

He is perhaps best known for his article \u201cOptimum Growth in an Aggregative Model of Capital Accumulation\u201d, which was a part of his dissertation. In this paper he proves a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in the neoclassical growth model first introduced by Frank Ramsey. A major difference to the standard Ramsey growth model was that Cass considered the case where consumption in future periods is discounted,\n\nstage, workers firstly become qualified (learning by-doing) so qualified workers paid more than unqualified. The concept of developing by working has been modeled by Mustafa Cicek, a Turkish economist within his PhD thesis at KTU Trabzon Turkey, in his design of endogenous and unbalanced regional growth theory to explain the effects of employment of unqualified rural people by government initiatives. For a developing economy which experiences seriously regional imbalances, the structure of the economy does not allow all people to be employed and all factors to be used in the provinces. To tackle these problems through regionalizing both endogenous and\n\nrequirements of full employment as in neoclassical theory, by exogenous demand as in Keynesian theory, or by the savings rate as in Harrodian theory. In his earlier work, he used this notion to develop a theory of long waves and crises based on a falling rate of profit. Subsequently, he showed that the link between growth and the profit rate can also provide an alternate theory of inflation, which he showed to work very well for the US in the postwar period. In more recent work, he has developed a formal classical profit-driven model of growth and contrasted its structure\n\nthe opinion that Say's Law of markets operates in underdeveloped countries. Thus, if the money incomes of the people rise while the price level in the economy stays the same, the size of the market will still not expand till the real income and productivity levels rise.

He added that \"Galor proposes a fairly simple, intensely human-capital-oriented model that will accommodate the millennia of Malthusian near-stagnation, the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath of rapid growth, the accompanying demographic transition, and the emergence of modern human-capital-based growth. And the model is supposed to generate endogenously the transitions from one era to the next.

For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when it may be necessary to restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.

The theory hypothesises that the government of any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest. Nurkse was in favour of attaining balanced growth in both the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy. He recognised that the expansion and inter-sectoral balance between agriculture and manufacturing is necessary so that each of these sectors provides a market\n\nwas a three-commodity, three-country study in international trade theory entitled \"Productivity Changes, the Trade Balance and the Terms of Trade\". With his classmate Keith Frearson, the Australian economist, Tom went to Joan Robinson's lectures on what would become \"The Accumulation of Capital\" \u2013 Robinson's \"magnum opus\", which sought to extend Keynes's theory to account for long-run issues of growth and capital accumulation. Initially Asimakopulos was irritated by Robinson's criticisms of the orthodox theories of value and distribution and neoclassical methodology on which he had been brought up. Asimakopulos also went regularly to research students's seminars run by Piero Sraffa, Robin\n\nunsystematic monetary policy; the Uzawa\u2013Lucas model (with Hirofumi Uzawa) of human capital accumulation; and the \"Lucas paradox\", which considers why more capital does not flow from developed countries to developing countries. Lucas (1988) is a seminal contribution in the economic development and growth literature. Lucas and Paul Romer heralded the birth of endogenous growth theory and the resurgence of research on economic growth in the late 1980s and the 1990s. He also contributed foundational contributions to behavioral economics, and provided the intellectual foundation for the understanding of deviations from the law of one price based on the irrationality of investors.\n\na certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations. The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics,\n\nAnthony Thirlwall Anthony Philip \"Tony\" Thirlwall (born 1941) is Professor of Applied Economics at the University of Kent. He has made major contributions to regional economics; the analysis of unemployment and inflation; balance of payments theory, and to growth and development economics with particular reference to developing countries. He is the author of the bestselling textbook \"Economics of Development: Theory and Evidence\" (Palgrave Macmillan) now in its ninth edition. He is also the biographer and literary executor of the famous Cambridge economist Nicholas Kaldor. Perhaps his most notable contribution has been to show that if long-run balance of payments equilibrium\n\nKaldor's model would lead us to conclude that the cycle might give way to either perpetual and rising inflation or stagnation. Kaldor's non-linear business cycle theory overcomes the difficulty that many economists had with Roy Harrod's growth theory. Many of the American Neo-Keynesian economists thought that Harrod's work implied that capitalism would tend toward extremes of zero and infinite growth and that there were no dynamics that might keep it in check. Robert Solow, who eventually created the Solow Growth Model in response to these perceived problems, summarised this view as such: In fact, Kaldor's 1940 paper had already shown\n\nSterling.

The economic dynamics are thus characterized by the research, the realization and the distribution of a surplus and there is a general equilibrium when there is no longer any realizable surplus. Allais\u2019s Hereditary, Relativist and Logistic (HRL) theory of monetary dynamics contains an original theory of expectations formation that is a genuine alternative to both adaptive and rational expectations. It was praised by Milton Friedman in 1968 with the following\n\nto that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves the creation of a brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country. Ragnar Nurkse's balanced growth theory The balanced growth theory is an economic theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907\u20131959). The theory hypothesises that the government of any\n\nThe theory is generally associated with Hirschman.  He presented a complete theoretical formulation of the strategy. Underdeveloped countries display common characteristics: low levels of GNI per capita and slow GNI per capita growth, large income inequalities and widespread poverty, low levels of productivity, great dependence on agriculture, a backward industrial structure, a high proportion of consumption and low savings, high rates of population growth and dependency burdens, high unemployment and underemployment, technological backwardness and dualism{existence of both traditional and modern sectors}. In a less-developed country, these characteristics lead to scarce resources or inadequate infrastructure to exploit these resources. With a\n\nto pure economic theory, mostly in the field of general equilibrium theory. He made major contributions to the theory of optimal growth, the theory of sunspots and the theory of incomplete markets. He is perhaps best known for his article \u201cOptimum Growth in an Aggregative Model of Capital Accumulation\u201d, which was a part of his dissertation. In this paper he proves a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in the neoclassical growth model first introduced by Frank Ramsey. A major difference to the standard Ramsey growth model was that Cass considered the case where consumption in future periods is discounted,\n\nstage, workers firstly become qualified (learning by-doing) so qualified workers paid more than unqualified. The concept of developing by working has been modeled by Mustafa Cicek, a Turkish economist within his PhD thesis at KTU Trabzon Turkey, in his design of endogenous and unbalanced regional growth theory to explain the effects of employment of unqualified rural people by government initiatives. For a developing economy which experiences seriously regional imbalances, the structure of the economy does not allow all people to be employed and all factors to be used in the provinces. To tackle these problems through regionalizing both endogenous and\n\nrequirements of full employment as in neoclassical theory, by exogenous demand as in Keynesian theory, or by the savings rate as in Harrodian theory. In his earlier work, he used this notion to develop a theory of long waves and crises based on a falling rate of profit. Subsequently, he showed that the link between growth and the profit rate can also provide an alternate theory of inflation, which he showed to work very well for the US in the postwar period. In more recent work, he has developed a formal classical profit-driven model of growth and contrasted its structure\n\nthe opinion that Say's Law of markets operates in underdeveloped countries. Thus, if the money incomes of the people rise while the price level in the economy stays the same, the size of the market will still not expand till the real income and productivity levels rise. To quote Nurkse, Citing the limited size of the market as the main impediment in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a virtuous circle of growth. Thus, a large scale investment programme in a wide array of industries simultaneously is the answer. The increase in demand for one\n\ntwo centuries. Reception Nobel Laureate in Economics Robert Solow described Galor's project as \"breathtakingly ambitious\". He added that \"Galor proposes a fairly simple, intensely human-capital-oriented model that will accommodate the millennia of Malthusian near-stagnation, the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath of rapid growth, the accompanying demographic transition, and the emergence of modern human-capital-based growth. And the model is supposed to generate endogenously the transitions from one era to the next. The resulting book is a powerful mixture of fact, theory, and interpretation.\" According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu, \"\"Unified Growth Theory\" is a work of unusual ambition\"\n\nthe world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when it may be necessary to restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.

The Walt Disney World Resort opened October 1, 1971, in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, with the Magic Kingdom theme park and three resort hotels. It expanded with the opening of Epcot in 1982, Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) and Disney's Typhoon Lagoon in 1989, Disney's Blizzard Beach in 1995, Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998, Disney\n\nDisney's Asian Resort Disney's Asian Resort was a planned resort to be located at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Its concept was developed in the 1960s and was expected to open in 1974, three years after its parent complex began operations. However, the 1973 oil crisis led to the cancellation of the project, in addition to Disney's Venetian Resort and Disney's Persian Resort. Inspired by the culture of Thailand, the hotel would have featured Thai furnishings and cuisine. Architectural plans featured a large center building more than 160 feet tall with a restaurant on top\n\n(replacing \"Rock 'n' Roll America\"), and the opening of the \"Rainforest Caf\u00e9\" in 1999 (replacing \"Key West\"). On January 25, 1999, a large McDonald\u2019s fast food restaurant opened whose theme was based on Italy's Commedia dell'arte. Later in 2004, a 570-seat IMAX cinema opened as part of the Gaumont multiplex. Finally, on December 3, 2004, an Art Deco themed multi-story parking structure called \"VINCI Park\" opened. In 2004, the resort management team began renovations that would take several years to complete. The neon lights, over-sized signs, and the central stage were all removed from the main area. Colorfully lit balloons\n\nThe resort is the first to be built in the complex in over seven years and the fifth to be placed in the value-priced category, along with Disney's All-Star Sports Resort, the All-Star Music Resort, the All-Star Movies Resort, and Disney's Pop Century Resort. Family suites opened on May 31, 2012, and standard rooms opened on September 15, 2012.\n\n1995. In 1996, the Disney Institute opened on February 9, and Disney's BoardWalk opened on July 1. The first of the World of Disney stores opened in the Disney Village Marketplace on October 3. The Downtown Disney district opened in November 1997, combining Disney Village Marketplace and Pleasure Island. A fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened at Disney World the week of April 20, 1998. The first Disney Vacation Club Resorts, Vacation Club Resort, opened on October 1, 1991, and was renamed Disney's Old Key West Resort in January 1996. These vacation club hotels were operated by Disney Vacation\n\narchitecture. New plans for the Dolphin and Swan hotels were submitted by Michael Graves in July 1986; ground breaking took place on January 28, 1988. The first non-Disney owned hotel, Pickett Suite Resort, opened in Disney World Village on March 15, 1987. On June 1, 1982, the Walt Disney World monorail line was extended to EPCOT Center from the Ticket and Transportation Center. The EPCOT Center theme park opened on October 1, 1982, at a building cost of US$1.2 billion, with two areas, Future World and World Showcase. Plans for a Hollywood-style theme park were announced in April 1985 for\n\nThe Magic of Disney Animation The Magic of Disney Animation was a show and tour at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Florida. A Disney animator would show guests how the characters in Disney animated films were chosen and designed. The attraction closed permanently on July 12, 2015. In December 2015, the building began to be used to house the \"Star Wars\" Launch Bay. Originally, when the park first opened in 1989, the \"Feature Animation\" pavilion of \"The Magic of Disney Animation,\" designed originally by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, included four connected experiences which explored\n\nwell as statues displayed behind glass windows. Lastly, a tip guests can keep in mind about this final room is that it can be entered without visiting the main attraction, allowing guests to return to view certain exhibits and take part in certain \"animation stations\" during their visit to the park. The Magic of Disney Animation was a show and tour at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Florida. The attraction closed permanently on July 12, 2015. At the time, it was not announced what would happen to the building and the animators. In December 2015, the building began to be used to\n\nmid-1992 due to the resort's financial crisis at the time. After the resort began to make a profit, these plans were revived on a much smaller scale. Walt Disney Studios Park opened on March 16, 2002. In June 2007, a new \"studio lot\" opened in the Animation Courtyard area of the park, named Toon Studio. It is themed as a \"toon backlot\", representing the film studio work place of animated characters, where they produce their animated films, including \"The Little Mermaid\", \"101 Dalmatians\", and \"The Jungle Book\". The concept has been created exclusively for Walt Disney Studios Park and features\n\nKing\", and \"The Little Mermaid\". Much like the other Disney Value Resorts, giant versions of various items are built around the hotel on each of the ten wings, such as a model of King Triton. In total, there are 1,984 rooms. of which 1,120 are family suites capable of housing up to six people, featuring living rooms and bedrooms. The remaining 864 sport the standard value layout. The resort has a total of ten buildings, as well as three themed pools.

As a characteristic with all Disney Value resorts, the resort features a music theme with giant novelty items such as guitars, trumpets, and drums. The resort is designated in the Florida Green Lodging Program. The groundbreaking for the All-Star Resort complex was in November 1992. The architect of the resort was Arquitectonica of Miami. All Star Music was the second All-Star Resort to open after Disney's All-Star Sports Resort. Calypso was the first building to open on November 22, 1994, and Broadway was the last to open on February\n\npens opened on April 8, 1974, renamed Discovery Island in 1977. On, the WEDway PeopleMover opened in the Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The first water park, River Country, opened on at Disney World. EPCOT Center's groundbreaking occurred at Walt Disney World in May 1979. In 1979, Oriental Land and Disney agreed to build a Japanese theme park. Tokyo Disneyland opened on on in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan. With the June 3, 1980, retirement of Donn Tatum as Walt Disney Productions' Chairman and CEO, three divisions were formed, including the Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division, of which Nunis was named division president.\n\nwetland, on April 23, 1993, the company agreed to form a wilderness preserve in Florida. The Disney Inn hotel was leased starting February 1, 1994, by the US Army, then purchased on January 12, 1996, and later renamed Shades of Green. Planet Hollywood opened a location in Pleasure Island on December 17, 1994. The third water park at Walt Disney World, Disney's Blizzard Beach, opened on April 1, 1995. The Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland was completely refurbished and reopened in June, 1995. Taking up a corner of the Magic Kingdom parking lot, the Walt Disney World Speedway opened on November 28,\n\nthe energy crisis bringing a downturn in tourism, which meant that Walt Disney World didn't need as many rooms, and the land stayed empty until Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa opened on the site in 1988. Since the Grand Floridian began operation, plans for an Asian-themed hotel at Walt Disney World Resort appear to have been shelved permanently.

The basilar portion is ossified from two centers, one in front of the other; these appear about the sixth week of fetal life\n\ncertain parts of irregular bones. Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the epiphyseal plate). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are\n\nthe vertebral arch. The centers for the arch appear about the seventh or eighth week of fetal life, while the centers for the body appear in about the fourth or fifth month.

The Eagles were led by quarterback Ron Jaworski, who completed 257 out of 451 passes for 3,529 yards during the regular season, including 27 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. Another key player on the Eagles offense was halfback Wilbert Montgomery, who was widely considered one of the top running backs in the NFL and had rushed for over 1,200 yards in each of the last two seasons. Injuries during the 1980\n\nplayed it safe by running the ball 3 times and forcing Philadelphia to use all of its timeouts. New England punter Josh Miller then pinned the Eagles back at their own 4-yard line with just 46 seconds left in the game. Philadelphia then tried one last desperate drive to win or tie the game. But on first down, McNabb was pressured into making a rushed pass to Westbrook at the line of scrimmage. Instead of dropping the pass to stop the clock, Westbrook made the mistake of catching the ball and was immediately tackled for no gain, keeping the clock\n\nleader was Jerry Rice with 23. This marked the first time in NFL history that a category leader doubled the total of his nearest competitor. Sunday, September 13, 1987 Kickoff 1:00 PM Eastern Played at Robert F.

Because of the NFLPA union's players strike against the NFL, all the games this week were cancelled. Replacement players were used when the\n\na Super Bowl XXXIX rematch with the New England Patriots. Foles had his best performance since Week 15, and his third best as an Eagles player, throwing for 352 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Eagles defeated the Patriots 41-33 to win their first Super Bowl title in franchise history, and their first championship since 1960. During the game, a trick play, known as the Philly Special was called where three players combined for a touchdown at 4th-and-Goal before halftime. Nick Foles was name the Super Bowl MVP, the first backup player or quarterback to earn this award. Foles was 28-of-43\n\nto overcome numerous injuries, particularly to its defense, to reach the NFC Championship for the third year in a row, only to suffer a heartbreaking 14-3 loss against the Carolina Panthers. On January 23, 2005, the Eagles reached a fourth consecutive conference championship game (the first time this happened in the salary cap era of the NFL). At long last, the Eagles justified the hopes of their long-suffering fan base, defeating Michael Vick's much-hyped Atlanta Falcons, 27-10, sending them to their first Super Bowl in 24 years. The victory sent the city of Philadelphia into wild celebrations.

On the Eagles\u2019 fourth play of the game, Bucs linebacker Kevin Murphy chased Cunningham out of the pocket, and he rolled to his left and floated a 37-yard TD to Mike Quick.

        "question": "Context: <P> of the Koh-I-Noor in 1790, remains in use. In 1802, the production of graphite leads from graphite and clay was patented by the Koh-I-Noor company in Vienna. In England, pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite. Henry Bessemer's first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused. American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the American Revolution. Benjamin Franklin advertised pencils for sale in his \"Pennsylvania Gazette\" in 1729, and George Washington used a three-inch pencil when he surveyed the Ohio Territory in\n\nthereby pushing a new tip to the top. Invented by Harold Grossman for Empire Pencil Company in 1967 and subsequently improved upon by Arthur D. Little for Empire from 1969 through the early 1970s; the plastic pencil was commercialised by Empire as the \"EPCON\" Pencil. These pencils were co-extruded, extruding a plasticised graphite mix within a wood-composite core. Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed. Although lead has not been used for writing since antiquity, lead poisoning from pencils was not uncommon. Until the middle of the 20th century the paint used\n\nin this fashion in 2005. The ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner. It stems from \"graphein\", meaning \"to write\" or \"draw\" in Ancient Greek. From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9 in 1795. It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead, whose ores had a similar appearance, hence the continuation of the name. Plumbago is another older\n\na method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found in 1662 in Italy. However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The town of Keswick, near the original findings of block graphite, still manufactures pencils, the factory also being the location of the Cumberland Pencil Museum. The meaning of \"graphite writing implement\" apparently evolved late in the 16th century. Around 1560, an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern, wood-encased carpentry pencil. Their version was a flat, oval, more\n\nPark neighborhood of historic Downtown Jersey City, New Jersey in 1847. The Dixon Mills complex has subsequently become residences. During the 1860s, people typically wrote with quill pens and ink even though Dixon introduced graphite pencils in 1829. But the American Civil War created a demand for a dry, clean, portable writing instrument and led to the mass production of pencils. At the time of Dixon's death in 1869, the Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the largest manufacturer of graphite products in the world. By 1870, The Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the world's largest dealer and consumer of graphite.\n\nappear to be true.\u201d Cont\u00e9 invented the modern pencil lead at the request of Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot. The French Republic was at that time under economic blockade and unable to import graphite from Great Britain, the main source of the material. Carnot asked Cont\u00e9 to create a pencil that did not rely on foreign imports. After several days of research, Cont\u00e9 had the idea of mixing powdered graphite with clay and pressing the material between two half-cylinders of wood. Thus was formed the modern pencil. Cont\u00e9 received a patent for the invention in 1795, and formed la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cont\u00e9\n\ntaken over by the Crown and were guarded. When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required. The usefulness of graphite for pencils was discovered as well, but graphite for pencils had to be smuggled. The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide, attracting the attention of artists all over the known world. Because graphite is soft, it requires some form of encasement. Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. England would enjoy a monopoly on the production of pencils until\n\nwooden-cased graphite lead pencils manufactured in the United States. Andrews was a previous customer of Munroe\u2019s, to whom he had sold cabinetmaker\u2019s squares. He ordered more immediately, which Munroe proceeded to grind out. Munroe showed up at Andrew\u2019s hardware store with over four hundred pencils less than two weeks later. Andrews then wrote up a contract with Munroe to take for a price all the pencils that he could make in a certain time frame. Munroe had then made a business out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only the help\n\na lead-based metal alloy that leaves dark markings on paper by abrading small pieces of core onto the surface. However, most modern \"lead pencils\" have a nonpoisonous core of greyish-black graphite mixed with various proportions of clay for consistency, enclosed within an outer wooden casing to protect the fragile graphite from being snapped apart or from leaving marks on the user's hand. White chalk has been traditionally used in schoolrooms to write on a main blackboard at the front of the room. In the 19th century, and indeed well into the 20th century, when paper was less readily available, individual\n\nsticks from the British Grey Knotts mines \u2013 the only known source in the world. France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute. It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleon's army to change this. In 1795, Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9 discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied. This method of manufacture, which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian Joseph Hardtmuth, the founder\n\never found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called plumbago (Latin for \"lead ore\"). Because the pencil core is still referred to as \"lead\", or a \"lead\", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, and the black core of pencils is still referred to as lead, even though it never contained the element lead.  The words for pencil in German (bleistift), Irish (peann luaidhe), Arabic (\u0642\u0644\u0645 \u0631\u0635\u0627\u0635 qalam ra\u1e63\u0101\u1e63), and some other languages literally mean lead pen.\n\npalm-leaf manuscripts. As a technique for drawing, the closest predecesor to the pencil was Silverpoint until in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called\n\nthe slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick. The business was a struggle at first, however in ten years' time he had sharpened his skills to perfection. He figured out how to make his machinery fabricate the wooden pencils efficiently in the old textile factory, creating the first and the most successful pencil company in the United States. Munroe took the lead in manufacturing pencils in the United States from that time forward as long as he was in the\n\ndrawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark. Munroe decided in 1819 he would go into pencil manufacturing full-time. He no longer desired to be number two. He made a square deal with his employees then to sell them his furniture business. He contracted with them to make his cabinet maker\u2019s squares and pencil blanks for payment of the shop business. Munroe in turn then produced the unique graphite paste for his pencils, of which only\n\nover the years in Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Mexico, USA, Pakistan, India, Germany (Osmia-Parker), Brazil and Argentina. In 1955, the company introduced its Liquid Lead pencil which used liquid graphite to write like a pen. Unfortunately, the Scripto company had introduced a similar product called Fluidlead a few months previously. To avoid a costly patent fight the companies agreed to share their formulas with each other. The company bought retailer and catalog company Norm Thompson in 1973, and then sold it in 1981. In 1976 Parker acquired Manpower just as the temporary staffing market was surging. In time Manpower\n\nfor the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead, and this could be ingested when the pencil was sucked or chewed. The lead of the pencil is a mix of finely ground graphite and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer),\n\ntop of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker\u2019s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste\n\nfounded by Joseph Dixon and his son. The pencil's name originates in the graphite ore discovered on Lead Mountain in 1815 and processed in Ticonderoga, New York.A museum dedicated to the Dixon pencil is located in Ticonderoga, New York on property adjacent to where the graphite processing facility once stood. In 2005, the company was acquired by FILA, a manufacturer of school and art supplies based in Milan, Italy. In 2008, Dixon acquired 200-year-old German-based manufacturer, LYRA. Dixon planned to begin distribution of Lyra products in the US in mid-2009. Since 2009 the director of business development for the Dixon\n\ncompact type of pencil. Their concept involved the hollowing out of a stick of juniper wood. Shortly thereafter, a superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved, a graphite stick inserted, and the halves then glued together\u2014essentially the same method in use to this day. The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1662. It used a mixture of graphite, sulphur, and antimony. English and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic Wars; France, under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain, was unable to import the pure graphite\n\nto that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination. Of the sources of lead for recycling, lead\u2013acid batteries are the most important; lead pipe, sheet, and cable sheathing are also significant. Contrary to popular belief, pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead. When the pencil originated as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the particular type of graphite used was named \"plumbago\" (literally, \"act for lead\" or \"lead mockup\"). Lead metal has several useful mechanical properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness.\n\nsticks. Because of its military importance, this unique mine and its production were strictly controlled by the Crown. During the 19th century, graphite's uses greatly expanded to include stove polish, lubricants, paints, crucibles, foundry facings, and pencils, a major factor in the expansion of educational tools during the first great rise of education for the masses.

In June 1961, Disney acquired the film rights. By 1964, Disney told his animation staff that he was planning to make a full-length animated feature film based on the books. A meeting was held with senior staff members to discuss the proposed film, and during the meeting, Disney decided not to make a feature film, but instead a\n\nthe Queen at Buckingham Palace. On 6 January 1930, Stephen Slesinger purchased US and Canadian merchandising, television, recording and other trade rights to the \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" works from Milne for a $1000 advance and 66% of Slesinger's income, creating the modern licensing industry. By November 1931, Pooh was a $50 million-a-year business. Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, US radio broadcast (NBC), animation, and motion picture film. The first time Pooh and his friends appeared in colour was 1932, when he was drawn by Slesinger in his\n\nchapters of the \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" book and the second, eighth and ninth chapters of \"The House at Pooh Corner\" by A. A. Milne. The featurette was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company on December 20, 1968 before \"The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit\". This was the second of the studio's Winnie the Pooh shorts. It was later added as a segment to the March 1977 film \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\". The music was written by Richard M.

Written by David Benedictus and illustrated by Mark Burgess, it was the first such book since 1928 and introduced the character Lottie the Otter. In the mid-1990s, after completing an audio adaptation of Milne's \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" stories, Benedictus wrote two \"Pooh\" short stories of his own and submitted them to the trustees of the Milne estate. The trustees replied that they were unable to publish the stories because \"Walt Disney owned all the rights.\"\n\nis produced by Shadow Projects and Playhouse Disney. Walt Disney Pictures released the first of two films, a direct-to-video spin-off film based on the puppetry television series titled \"\" in 2001. In 2011, Relient K re-recorded the theme song for the show for Disney Junior - Live on Stage! The series appears to take place some time after the events of Milne's original stories since his son Christopher Robin Milne is clearly a sixth grader and 11 years old. The series departs from many of the established facts of Milne's books; for example, Tigger resides in the Hundred Acre Wood\n\nanimated feature film. Inspired by A. A. Milne's stories of the same name, the film is part of Disney's \"Winnie the Pooh\" franchise, the fifth theatrical Winnie the Pooh film released, and Walt Disney Animation Studios' second adaptation of \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" stories. Upon learning that Eeyore has lost his tail, the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood start a contest to see who can find a new one for the melancholy donkey \u2014 with a pot of honey going to the winner. Amid the goings-on, Owl mistakenly relates the news that Christopher Robin has been abducted by a monster called The\n\nthe Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne. These products ushered in a new licensing division titled \u201cClassic Winnie the Pooh\u201d which was a departure in Disney's marketing of Winnie the Pooh products in the U.S. Several editions of Winnie-the-Pooh and other characters from the Hundred Acre Wood were produced. Under license with Disney, the R. John Wright company went on to produce many Disney art character dolls including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Cinderella, Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs set won the RJW Company the Award of Excellence from DOLLS\n\nThe rights to A. A. Milne's Pooh books were left to four beneficiaries: his family, the Royal Literary Fund, Westminster School and the Garrick Club. After Milne's death in 1956, one week and six days after his 74th birthday, his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to Stephen Slesinger, whose widow sold the rights after Slesinger's death to the Walt Disney Company, which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a Disney Channel television show, as well as Pooh-related merchandise.

In this game, D\u017eeko broke another record by becoming the first Manchester City player to score four goals in one Premier League match. His tally of six league goals in three games won him the Premier League Player of the Month award for August. Further on, he grabbed some important goals such as a header against Wigan Athletic that sealed a 1\u20130 win for City and extended their lead over title rivals Manchester United to three points,\n\nArsenal. The Premier League Golden Boot award was also won by Ruud van Nistelrooy who scored 25 goals in 38 league matches and 44 in all competitions. He also equalled his record of eight goals in eight successive matches at the beginning of the season, a milestone he had reached the previous season. Van Nistelrooy finished one goal ahead of Arsenal's Thierry Henry while James Beattie managed 23 league goals for Southampton. Since the reduction of the number of games from 42 to 38 in 1996, only Kevin Phillips had scored more Premiership goals in one season \u2013 30 for\n\na new contract with Sunderland, committing his future to the club until 2019.

He was accredited with spearheading the title win for United with a goal tally that was described as \"astonishing\". After scoring 12 Champions League goals, he was named by UEFA as the best striker in Europe. Van Nistelrooy started the 2003\u201304 season by scoring twice in his first two league matches. This meant he had scored in 10 consecutive league games, then a Premier League record,\n\nto have scored more than one treble\" in the top tier. On 4 December, Su\u00e1rez scored four goals against Norwich City in a 5\u20131 home win.

He scored twice and assisted once as the team recorded a 5\u20130 win at White Hart Lane to close the gap on league leaders Arsenal to\n\nscoring a lovely curling effort with his left foot in the fifth minute against Tottenham Hotspur. This brought him on to 13 league goals for the season, and meant that he had scored four in his last five games. On 30 April, Odemwingie became the first player in West Brom's Premier League history to score in four consecutive games. This goal came against Aston Villa and meant he had scored 15 goals thus far in his debut season.

Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record for scoring 13 goals in 11 consecutive league games, in the 2015\u201316 Premier League season. Vardy is also the ninth player to score 20 top-flight goals in a season, following Arthur Chandler, Ernie Hine, Arthur Rowley, Jimmy Walsh, Ken Keyworth, Jackie Sinclair, Frank Worthington and Gary Lineker. Vardy's goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first player since Gary Lineker in 1984\u201385 to score 20 top flight goals for the club, having already become Leicester's\n\nthe 2006\u201307 season against Manchester City scoring the first goal in a 2\u20131 victory that saw Tottenham secure fifth place in the league.

His tally of 19 league goals in the calendar year was the highest of any player in the Premier League throughout\n\nDuring the 1995\u201396 season, Alan Shearer became the first player to score 100 Premier League goals, and holds the record for the fewest games taken to reach 100, doing so in 124 appearances.  He also holds the record for most goals scored in the Premier League. After Shearer, Harry Kane is the second-fastest to 100 goals, doing so in 141 games.\n\nthis up with another goal the following week in a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester City, and a late consolation in a 3\u20131 away loss to Liverpool. At this point of the season he was the Premier League's leading goalscorer. He was sent off in a 2\u20131 loss against Norwich for a headbutt on Marc Tierney on 18 September 2011, forcing him to fall out of the team. His first start after his red card was in a 5\u20130 win against Stoke City on 6 November in which he scored two goals and gave assists for two others. He then scored\n\nwhile playing for German club VfL Wolfsburg, with whom he won the Bundesliga in the 2008\u201309 season. He was second-highest goalscorer with 26 goals. In the 2009\u201310 season, D\u017eeko was the top scorer with 22 goals. He also registered ten assists in both seasons. During the 2011\u201312 Premier League season, D\u017eeko scored four goals in one game for Manchester City against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. On the final day of that season, he scored an equaliser against Queens Park Rangers in the 92nd minute, before Sergio Ag\u00fcero won it for City with seconds to go, ensuring the team\n\nhe became the first player to score 200 Premier League goals, while in November with a 'rocket' free kick, he became the first player to score 100 league goals for two different Premier League clubs. On receipt of his Premier League Domestic Player of the Decade award, Shearer stated: I am genuinely humbled to be lifting the award when there are so many other players I have either played with or against that would have been extremely worthy recipients.

On 14 April, Ag\u00fcero scored a double in a 6\u20131 away win against Norwich City, his two goals meaning that he had surpassed 20 league goals in the Premier League. He scored one goal in the next match, in which Manchester City beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2\u20130. On 4 May, Ag\u00fcero was named Manchester City Player of The Year. His first goal in the 6\u20131 away win against Norwich also won him the club's Goal of the Season award. Five straight wins helped City wipe out the\n\nLeicester City and a 7\u20131 win against Hull City, Kane finished as the top scorer of the Premier League on 29 goals, and thus won his second consecutive Golden Boot, becoming only the fifth player to do so. After not finding the back of the net in Tottenham's first three games, Kane scored a brace in three of his next four appearances for the club across all competitions. His opening goal against Everton on 9 September was his 100th overall for the club, coming in his 169th appearance. On 26 September, Kane scored his first UEFA Champions League hat-trick in\n\nno release clause with Liverpool which would keep him at the club until 2022. He then was named man of the match in his performance in the 3\u20131 Merseyside victory over Everton after scoring and assisting a goal. Coutinho became the all-time leading Brazilian goalscorer in Premier League history after scoring his 30th Premier League goal in a win against Stoke City. In August 2017, Liverpool rejected a \u00a372 million bid from Barcelona for Coutinho, prompting the player to submit a transfer request over email. Two more improved bids from Barcelona were rejected, leading \"Bar\u00e7a\" director Albert Soler to claim\n\nfor Manchester United in all competitions, thus becoming Manchester United's 50th player to score 50 goals for the club. This was also his first goal of the 2011\u201312 Premier League season. On 26 December 2011, Berbatov scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20130 win against Wigan Athletic. This was Berbatov's fourth Premier League hat trick for Manchester United and fifth overall in the division. In the next league game against Blackburn Rovers, Berbatov gave away a first half penalty, when he dragged Christopher Samba to the ground. In the second half, after going 2\u20130 behind, United responded quickly with two goals\n\n7\u20134 win over Reading, which broke the record for the most goals scored in a Premier League match, and a league match shown on \"Match of the Day\". After Portsmouth's visit to Wigan on 20 October, Benjani became the Premier League's top scorer. Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp banned Benjani from taking any further penalties after he missed a spot-kick in second-half injury time in a home game against West Ham United. He then made amends for his miss scoring in the 4\u20131 victory over Newcastle United to bring his total to eight for the season. He then scored his ninth\n\nFulham. This also meant le Fondre clinched the record for most Premier League goals in a season as a substitute. On 14 May, he was named Reading F.C. Player of the Season. He also scored in Reading's 4\u20132 defeat at West Ham United on the final day of the season, when he turned in Nick Blackman's cross to equalize after coming off the bench at half time.

In his third Premier League game of this season, D\u017eeko scored four goals against Tottenham Hotspur. In this game, D\u017eeko broke another record by becoming the first Manchester City player to score four goals in one Premier League match. His tally of six league goals in three games won him the Premier League Player of the Month award for August. Further on, he grabbed some important goals such as a header against Wigan Athletic that sealed a 1\u20130 win for City and extended their lead over title rivals Manchester United to three points,\n\nArsenal. The Premier League Golden Boot award was also won by Ruud van Nistelrooy who scored 25 goals in 38 league matches and 44 in all competitions. He also equalled his record of eight goals in eight successive matches at the beginning of the season, a milestone he had reached the previous season. Van Nistelrooy finished one goal ahead of Arsenal's Thierry Henry while James Beattie managed 23 league goals for Southampton. Since the reduction of the number of games from 42 to 38 in 1996, only Kevin Phillips had scored more Premiership goals in one season \u2013 30 for\n\na new contract with Sunderland, committing his future to the club until 2019. On 13 August 2016, the opening day of the 2016\u201317 Premier League, Defoe scored in a 2\u20131 loss at Manchester City, meaning he has now scored in 16 Premier League seasons. On 5 November 2016, Defoe scored the winning goal from the penalty spot as 10-man Sunderland came from behind to win at Bournemouth, their first league win of the season. On 19 November 2016, Defoe scored his 150th Premier League goal in a 3\u20130 home win against Hull City, becoming the joint seventh highest goal scorer\n\nFulham, and Charlton Athletic. He also scored in each of the final eight games of the season as United won the title. Van Nistelrooy won the Premier League Player of the Season in 2003. He was accredited with spearheading the title win for United with a goal tally that was described as \"astonishing\". After scoring 12 Champions League goals, he was named by UEFA as the best striker in Europe. Van Nistelrooy started the 2003\u201304 season by scoring twice in his first two league matches. This meant he had scored in 10 consecutive league games, then a Premier League record,\n\nto have scored more than one treble\" in the top tier. On 4 December, Su\u00e1rez scored four goals against Norwich City in a 5\u20131 home win. He became the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks against the same club, and took his scoring record against Norwich to 11 goals in 5 matches. On 15 December, Su\u00e1rez captained Liverpool for the first time in a Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur. He scored twice and assisted once as the team recorded a 5\u20130 win at White Hart Lane to close the gap on league leaders Arsenal to\n\nscoring a lovely curling effort with his left foot in the fifth minute against Tottenham Hotspur. This brought him on to 13 league goals for the season, and meant that he had scored four in his last five games. On 30 April, Odemwingie became the first player in West Brom's Premier League history to score in four consecutive games. This goal came against Aston Villa and meant he had scored 15 goals thus far in his debut season. It would also contribute to Odemwingie's second Premier League Player of the Month award of the season. His side faced Everton at\n\nin the season opener against Sunderland in a 4\u20132 home win. He was later described as the club's \"match winner\" by captain Wes Morgan, following \"superb form\" which saw him score four goals in the first three games of the season. After scoring four goals in the opening four games of the 2015\u201316 season, Mahrez was nominated for the Premier League Player of the Month award. By 3 November 2015, he had scored seven goals in 10 Premier League games. On 5 December, Mahrez scored a hat-trick as Leicester defeated Swansea City 3\u20130 to go top of the Premier League,\n\nhis first two goals of 2015 in a 4\u20131 win at Stoke City. On 21 February 72 seconds into a match against Newcastle United, Ag\u00fcero scored the fastest penalty kick in the Premier League since 1994. On 12 April, Ag\u00fcero scored twice in a 4\u20132 Manchester derby loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. His second goal of the match took him to 100 goals for Manchester City in all competitions. On 19 April, he scored his 20th Premier League goal of the season in a 2\u20130 home win against West Ham United. He passed 30 goals for the season\n\nwhen he netted after just nine seconds against Preston North End in April 2006. Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record for scoring 13 goals in 11 consecutive league games, in the 2015\u201316 Premier League season. Vardy is also the ninth player to score 20 top-flight goals in a season, following Arthur Chandler, Ernie Hine, Arthur Rowley, Jimmy Walsh, Ken Keyworth, Jackie Sinclair, Frank Worthington and Gary Lineker. Vardy's goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first player since Gary Lineker in 1984\u201385 to score 20 top flight goals for the club, having already become Leicester's\n\nthe 2006\u201307 season against Manchester City scoring the first goal in a 2\u20131 victory that saw Tottenham secure fifth place in the league.

        "question": "Context: <P> is made in the cytoplasm, an enzyme called farnesyl transferase attaches a farnesyl functional group to its carboxyl-terminus. The farnesylated prelamin A is then transported through a nuclear pore to the interior of the nucleus. The farnesyl group allows prelamin A to attach temporarily to the nuclear rim. Once the protein is attached, it is cleaved by a protease, thereby removing the farnesyl group along with a few adjacent amino acids. Failure to remove this farnesyl group permanently affixes the protein to the nuclear rim. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as lamin A. Lamin A,\n\nring structure located in the middle of the cell called the Z-ring that constricts during cell division, similar to the actin-myosin contractile ring in eukaryotes. The Z-ring is a highly dynamic structure that consists of numerous bundles of protofilaments that extend and shrink, although the mechanism behind Z-ring contraction and the number of protofilaments involved are unclear. FtsZ acts as an organizer protein and is required for cell division. It is the first component of the septum during cytokinesis, and it recruits all other known cell division proteins to the division site. Despite this functional similarity to actin, FtsZ is\n\namino acids. So, Protegrin-2 is shorter than Protegrin-1 and it has one less positive charge. Protegrin-3 substitutes a glycine for an arginine at position 4 and it also has one less positive charge. Protegrin-4 substitutes a phenylalanine for a valine at position 14 and sequences are different in the \u03b2-turn. This difference makes protegrin-4 less polar than others and less positively charged. Protegrin-5 substitutes a proline for an arginine with one less positive charge. Protegrin-1 induces membrane disruption by forming a pore/channel that leads to cell death. This ability depends on its secondary structure. It forms an oligomeric structure in\n\nthe insulin receptor. Due to the relative similarities in structure, proinsulin can produce between 5% and 10% of the metabolic activity similarly induced by insulin. Proinsulin is the final single chain protein structure secreted by cells before cleavage into mature insulin. Proinsulin was discovered by Professor Donald F. Steiner of the University of Chicago in 1967. Proinsulin is made up of 81 residues and formed by three distinct chains. The A chain, B chain, and the area connecting the two named the C peptide. The correct structure of proinsulin is crucial for the correct folding of mature insulin, as the\n\nby the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins. Proteasomes are found inside all eukaryotes and archaea, and in some bacteria. In eukaryotes, proteasomes are located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In structure, the proteasome is a cylindrical complex containing a \"core\" of four stacked rings forming a central pore. Each ring is composed of seven individual proteins. The inner two rings are made of seven \"\u03b2 subunits\"\n\nforms at the onset of assembly. Free microtubules elongate the initial cylindrical structure of procentrioles to form centrioles. An alternative way of procentriole assembly has also been discovered. Instead of forming in the vicinity of pre-exisintg centrioles, this \u201cde novo\u201d pathway is activated during ciliogenesis, inch which many procentrioles are synthesized in a single cell from electron-dense areas of the cytoplasm. This discovery was made through observation after removing the pre-existing centrioles using laser microbeam. However, studies indicate that procentriole assembly via the canonical pathway is more stable for proliferating cells. Only one procentriole forms next to each centriole during\n\nresidue of an alpha helix and also in the edge strands of beta sheets. Proline is also commonly found in turns (another kind of secondary structure), and aids in the formation of beta turns. This may account for the curious fact that proline is usually solvent-exposed, despite having a completely aliphatic side chain. Multiple prolines and/or hydroxyprolines in a row can create a polyproline helix, the predominant secondary structure in collagen. The hydroxylation of proline by prolyl hydroxylase (or other additions of electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine) increases the conformational stability of collagen significantly. Hence, the hydroxylation of proline is\n\ncell growth) and in the positioning of mitochondria. The cytokinetic ring forms and constricts around the site of cell division. Prior to the work of Jones et al., 2001, the cell wall was believed to be the deciding factor for many bacterial cell shapes, including rods and spirals. When studied, many misshapen bacteria were found to have mutations linked to development of a cell envelope. The cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryotic cells, but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes. Harold Erickson notes that before 1992,\n\nLactotropic cell A lactotropic cell (also known as prolactin cell, epsilon acidophil, lactotrope, lactotroph, mammatroph, mammotroph) is a cell in the anterior pituitary which produces prolactin in response to hormonal signals including dopamine which is inhibitory and thyrotropin-releasing hormone which is stimulatory. Other regulators include oxytocin, estrogen and progesterone. Prolactin is involved in the maturation of mammary glands and their secretion of milk in association with oxytocin, estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and others. Prolactin has numerous other effects in both sexes. Prolactin cells are acidophilic by hematoxylin & eosin stains and comprise about 20% of all cells in the anterior pituitary\n\nchain (produced by the COL1A2 gene) to make a molecule of type I procollagen. These triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules must be processed by enzymes outside the cell. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that cross-link to one another in the spaces around cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong mature type I collagen fibers. Collagenous function includes rigidity and elasticity. The COL1A1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 between positions 21.3 and 22.1, from base pair 45,616,455 to base pair 45,633,991. Mutations in the COL1A1 gene\n\nTranscription occurs in the cell nucleus, where the DNA is held.  The DNA structure of the cell is made up of two helixes made up of sugar and phosphate held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of opposite strands. The sugar and the phosphate in each strand are joined together by stronger phosphodiester covalent bonds. The DNA is \"unzipped\" (disruption of hydrogen bonds between different single strands) by the enzyme helicase, leaving the single nucleotide chain open to be copied. RNA polymerase reads the DNA strand from the 3-prime (3') end to the 5-prime (5') end, while it synthesizes\n\ndetermines cell shape by mediating the position and activity of enzymes that synthesize peptidoglycan and by acting as a rigid filament under the cell membrane that exerts outward pressure to sculpt and bolster the cell. MreB condenses from its normal helical network and forms a tight ring at the septum in \"Caulobacter crescentus\" right before cell division, a mechanism that is believed to help locate its off-center septum. MreB is also important for polarity determination in polar bacteria, as it is responsible for the correct positioning of at least four different polar proteins in \"C. crescentus\". Crescentin (encoded by \"creS\"\n\na cell cycle. Procentriole A procentriole ( ) is a centriole or basal body in a stage of early development. That is, it is what is to become a set of triplets of microtubules destined to form spindles of fibres that will separate chromosomes during mitosis and in order to act as anchoring sites for some proteins. Procentrioles are generally assembled canonically in association with pre-existing centrioles that are loosely connected to each other. The environment suitable for procentriole formation is provided by the base of each centriole. Procentrioles assemble perpendicular to existing centrioles. A cylindrical structure with a diameter\n\nfollow along with the typical Ramachandran plot, along with glycine. Due to the ring formation connected to the beta carbon, the \u03c8 and \u03c6 angles about the peptide bond have fewer allowable degrees of rotation. As a result, it is often found in \"turns\" of proteins as its free entropy (\u0394S) is not as comparatively large to other amino acids and thus in a folded form vs. unfolded form, the change in entropy is less. Furthermore, proline is rarely found in \u03b1 and \u03b2 structures as it would reduce the stability of such structures, because its side chain \u03b1-N can\n\nthen join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a \"protofilament\". Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike \"filament\". These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal. Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as \"laminopathies\". The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature\n\nPOMC, however, may vary between different tissues, yielding different sets of polypeptide hormones from the same polyprotein. Many viruses also produce their proteins initially as a single polypeptide chain that were translated from a polycistronic mRNA. This polypeptide is subsequently cleaved into individual polypeptide chains. Many proteins and hormones are synthesized in the form of their precursors - zymogens, proenzymes, and prehormones. These proteins are cleaved to form their final active structures. Insulin, for example, is synthesized as preproinsulin, which yields proinsulin after the signal peptide has been cleaved. The proinsulin is then cleaved at two positions to yield two\n\nType I collagen Type I collagen is the most abundant collagen of the human body which forms large, eosinophilic fibers known as collagen fibers. It is present in scar tissue, the end product when tissue heals by repair, as well as tendons, ligaments, the endomysium of myofibrils, the organic part of bone, the dermis, the dentin and organ capsules. The COL1A1 gene produces the pro-alpha1(I) chain. This chain combines with another pro-alpha1(I) chain and also with a pro-alpha2(I) chain (produced by the COL1A2 gene) to make a molecule of type I procollagen. These triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules must be processed\n\nbeta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue signal peptide which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming proinsulin. In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed. About 5\u201310 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where immature granules are formed. Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min. Proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin through the action of cellular endopeptidases known as prohormone\n\ncalled the nuclear lamina that helps organize nuclear processes such as RNA and DNA synthesis. Prelamin A contains a CAAX box at the C-terminus of the protein (where C is a cysteine and A is any aliphatic amino acids). This ensures that the cysteine is farnesylated and allows prelamin A to bind membranes, specifically the nuclear membrane. After prelamin A has been localized to the cell nuclear membrane, the C-terminal amino acids, including the farnesylated cysteine, are cleaved off by a specific protease. The resulting protein, now lamin A, is no longer membrane-bound and carries out functions inside the nucleus.\n\nthat make up the beta-casein proteins: a proline occurs at position 67 in the chain of amino acids that make up the A2 beta-casein, while in A1 beta-casein a histidine occurs at that position. Studies in cells found that digestive enzymes that cut up proteins interact with beta-casein precisely at that location, so that A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins are processed differently. A seven-aminoacid peptide, beta-casomorphin-7, (BCM-7) can be cut away from the A1-beta-casein protein by those enzymes, but the enzymes cannot cut the A2 protein at that location, so BCM-7 is not formed from A2 proteins.

Hydroxyproline (2\"S\",4\"R\")-4-Hydroxyproline, or -hydroxyproline (CHON), is a common non-proteinogenic amino acid, abbreviated as Hyp, \"e.g.\", in Protein Data Bank. In 1902, Hermann Emil Fischer isolated hydroxyproline from hydrolyzed gelatin. In 1905, Hermann Leuchs synthesized a racemic mixture of 4-hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline differs from proline by the presence of a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to the gamma carbon atom. Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase following protein synthesis (as a post-translational modification). The enzyme catalyzed reaction takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it is</P>\nQuestion: where is the protien made in the cell",

The farnesylated prelamin A is then transported through a nuclear pore to the interior of the nucleus. The farnesyl group allows prelamin A to attach temporarily to the nuclear rim. Once the protein is attached, it is cleaved by a protease, thereby removing the farnesyl group along with a few adjacent amino acids. Failure to remove this farnesyl group permanently affixes the protein to the nuclear rim. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as lamin A. Lamin A,\n\nring structure located in the middle of the cell called the Z-ring that constricts during cell division, similar to the actin-myosin contractile ring in eukaryotes. The Z-ring is a highly dynamic structure that consists of numerous bundles of protofilaments that extend and shrink, although the mechanism behind Z-ring contraction and the number of protofilaments involved are unclear. FtsZ acts as an organizer protein and is required for cell division. It is the first component of the septum during cytokinesis, and it recruits all other known cell division proteins to the division site. Despite this functional similarity to actin, FtsZ is\n\namino acids. So, Protegrin-2 is shorter than Protegrin-1 and it has one less positive charge. Protegrin-3 substitutes a glycine for an arginine at position 4 and it also has one less positive charge. Protegrin-4 substitutes a phenylalanine for a valine at position 14 and sequences are different in the \u03b2-turn. This difference makes protegrin-4 less polar than others and less positively charged. Protegrin-5 substitutes a proline for an arginine with one less positive charge. Protegrin-1 induces membrane disruption by forming a pore/channel that leads to cell death. This ability depends on its secondary structure. It forms an oligomeric structure in\n\nthe insulin receptor. Due to the relative similarities in structure, proinsulin can produce between 5% and 10% of the metabolic activity similarly induced by insulin. Proinsulin is the final single chain protein structure secreted by cells before cleavage into mature insulin. Proinsulin was discovered by Professor Donald F. Steiner of the University of Chicago in 1967. Proinsulin is made up of 81 residues and formed by three distinct chains. The A chain, B chain, and the area connecting the two named the C peptide. The correct structure of proinsulin is crucial for the correct folding of mature insulin, as the\n\nby the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins. Proteasomes are found inside all eukaryotes and archaea, and in some bacteria. In eukaryotes, proteasomes are located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In structure, the proteasome is a cylindrical complex containing a \"core\" of four stacked rings forming a central pore. Each ring is composed of seven individual proteins. The inner two rings are made of seven \"\u03b2 subunits\"\n\nforms at the onset of assembly. Free microtubules elongate the initial cylindrical structure of procentrioles to form centrioles. An alternative way of procentriole assembly has also been discovered. Instead of forming in the vicinity of pre-exisintg centrioles, this \u201cde novo\u201d pathway is activated during ciliogenesis, inch which many procentrioles are synthesized in a single cell from electron-dense areas of the cytoplasm. This discovery was made through observation after removing the pre-existing centrioles using laser microbeam. However, studies indicate that procentriole assembly via the canonical pathway is more stable for proliferating cells. Only one procentriole forms next to each centriole during\n\nresidue of an alpha helix and also in the edge strands of beta sheets. Proline is also commonly found in turns (another kind of secondary structure), and aids in the formation of beta turns. This may account for the curious fact that proline is usually solvent-exposed, despite having a completely aliphatic side chain. Multiple prolines and/or hydroxyprolines in a row can create a polyproline helix, the predominant secondary structure in collagen. The hydroxylation of proline by prolyl hydroxylase (or other additions of electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine) increases the conformational stability of collagen significantly. Hence, the hydroxylation of proline is\n\ncell growth) and in the positioning of mitochondria. The cytokinetic ring forms and constricts around the site of cell division. Prior to the work of Jones et al., 2001, the cell wall was believed to be the deciding factor for many bacterial cell shapes, including rods and spirals. When studied, many misshapen bacteria were found to have mutations linked to development of a cell envelope. The cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryotic cells, but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes. Harold Erickson notes that before 1992,\n\nLactotropic cell A lactotropic cell (also known as prolactin cell, epsilon acidophil, lactotrope, lactotroph, mammatroph, mammotroph) is a cell in the anterior pituitary which produces prolactin in response to hormonal signals including dopamine which is inhibitory and thyrotropin-releasing hormone which is stimulatory. Other regulators include oxytocin, estrogen and progesterone. Prolactin is involved in the maturation of mammary glands and their secretion of milk in association with oxytocin, estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and others. Prolactin has numerous other effects in both sexes. Prolactin cells are acidophilic by hematoxylin & eosin stains and comprise about 20% of all cells in the anterior pituitary\n\nchain (produced by the COL1A2 gene) to make a molecule of type I procollagen. These triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules must be processed by enzymes outside the cell. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that cross-link to one another in the spaces around cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong mature type I collagen fibers. Collagenous function includes rigidity and elasticity. The COL1A1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 between positions 21.3 and 22.1, from base pair 45,616,455 to base pair 45,633,991. Mutations in the COL1A1 gene\n\nTranscription occurs in the cell nucleus, where the DNA is held.  The DNA structure of the cell is made up of two helixes made up of sugar and phosphate held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of opposite strands. The sugar and the phosphate in each strand are joined together by stronger phosphodiester covalent bonds. The DNA is \"unzipped\" (disruption of hydrogen bonds between different single strands) by the enzyme helicase, leaving the single nucleotide chain open to be copied. RNA polymerase reads the DNA strand from the 3-prime (3') end to the 5-prime (5') end, while it synthesizes\n\ndetermines cell shape by mediating the position and activity of enzymes that synthesize peptidoglycan and by acting as a rigid filament under the cell membrane that exerts outward pressure to sculpt and bolster the cell. MreB condenses from its normal helical network and forms a tight ring at the septum in \"Caulobacter crescentus\" right before cell division, a mechanism that is believed to help locate its off-center septum. MreB is also important for polarity determination in polar bacteria, as it is responsible for the correct positioning of at least four different polar proteins in \"C. crescentus\". Crescentin (encoded by \"creS\"\n\na cell cycle. Procentriole A procentriole ( ) is a centriole or basal body in a stage of early development. That is, it is what is to become a set of triplets of microtubules destined to form spindles of fibres that will separate chromosomes during mitosis and in order to act as anchoring sites for some proteins. Procentrioles are generally assembled canonically in association with pre-existing centrioles that are loosely connected to each other. The environment suitable for procentriole formation is provided by the base of each centriole. Procentrioles assemble perpendicular to existing centrioles. A cylindrical structure with a diameter\n\nfollow along with the typical Ramachandran plot, along with glycine. Due to the ring formation connected to the beta carbon, the \u03c8 and \u03c6 angles about the peptide bond have fewer allowable degrees of rotation. As a result, it is often found in \"turns\" of proteins as its free entropy (\u0394S) is not as comparatively large to other amino acids and thus in a folded form vs. unfolded form, the change in entropy is less. Furthermore, proline is rarely found in \u03b1 and \u03b2 structures as it would reduce the stability of such structures, because its side chain \u03b1-N can\n\nthen join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a \"protofilament\". Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike \"filament\". These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal. Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as \"laminopathies\". The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature\n\nPOMC, however, may vary between different tissues, yielding different sets of polypeptide hormones from the same polyprotein. Many viruses also produce their proteins initially as a single polypeptide chain that were translated from a polycistronic mRNA. This polypeptide is subsequently cleaved into individual polypeptide chains. Many proteins and hormones are synthesized in the form of their precursors - zymogens, proenzymes, and prehormones. These proteins are cleaved to form their final active structures. Insulin, for example, is synthesized as preproinsulin, which yields proinsulin after the signal peptide has been cleaved. The proinsulin is then cleaved at two positions to yield two\n\nType I collagen Type I collagen is the most abundant collagen of the human body which forms large, eosinophilic fibers known as collagen fibers. It is present in scar tissue, the end product when tissue heals by repair, as well as tendons, ligaments, the endomysium of myofibrils, the organic part of bone, the dermis, the dentin and organ capsules. The COL1A1 gene produces the pro-alpha1(I) chain. This chain combines with another pro-alpha1(I) chain and also with a pro-alpha2(I) chain (produced by the COL1A2 gene) to make a molecule of type I procollagen. These triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules must be processed\n\nbeta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue signal peptide which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming proinsulin. In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed. About 5\u201310 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where immature granules are formed.

A revival meeting usually consists of several\n\nnew members enrolled in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ. While the First Great Awakening was centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, the Second focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. The principal innovation produced by the revivals was the camp meeting.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening occurred in several episodes and over different denominations; however, the revivals were very similar. As the most effective form of evangelizing during this period, revival meetings cut across geographical boundaries, and the movement quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio.  Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier.

Certain denominations took the lead in different geographic areas. Camp meetings today are often held annually at campgrounds owned by a Christian denomination. The camp meeting is a phenomenon of American frontier Christianity, as well as British Christianity, but with strong roots in\n\nmany groups during the Second Great Awakening, including the Mormons, Baptists and Shakers. Several factors made the restoration sentiment particularly appealing during this time period: The Restoration Movement began during, and was greatly influenced by, the Second Great Awakening. While the leaders of one of the two primary groups making up this movement, Thomas Campbell and Alexander Campbell, resisted what they saw as the spiritual manipulation of the camp meetings, the revivals contributed to the development of the other major branch, led by Barton W.

The Methodists and Baptists made them one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination. The Christianity of the black population was grounded in evangelicalism. The Second Great Awakening has been called the \"central and defining event in the\n\nRevival meeting A revival meeting is a series of Christian religious services held to inspire active members of a church body to gain new converts. Nineteenth-century Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon said, \"Many blessings may come to the unconverted in consequence of a revival among Christians, but the revival itself has to do only with those who already possess spiritual life.\" These meetings are usually conducted by churches or missionary organizations throughout the world. Notable historic revival meetings were conducted in the US by evangelist Billy Sunday and in Wales by evangelist Evan Roberts. A revival meeting usually consists of several\n\nnew members enrolled in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ. While the First Great Awakening was centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, the Second focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. The principal innovation produced by the revivals was the camp meeting.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening occurred in several episodes and over different denominations; however, the revivals were very similar. As the most effective form of evangelizing during this period, revival meetings cut across geographical boundaries, and the movement quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio.  Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as circuit riders, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped\n\nCane Ridge Revival The Cane Ridge Revival was a large camp meeting that was held in Cane Ridge, Kentucky from August 6 to August 12 or 13, 1801. It has been described as the \"[l]argest and most famous camp meeting of the Second Great Awakening.\" This camp meeting was arguably the pioneering event in the history of frontier camp meetings in America. It was based at the Cane Ridge Meeting House and drew between 10,000 and 20,000 people. According to \"The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement\", logistical considerations make it unlikely that more than 10,000 could have been present at\n\na majority that tends to impose its own standards. The Grundtvigian and Home Mission revival movements arose in Denmark after 1860 and reshaped religion in that country, and among immigrants to America. In the U.S. the Second Great Awakening (1800\u201330s) was the second great religious revival in United States history and consisted of renewed personal salvation experienced in revival meetings. Major leaders included Asahel Nettleton, James Brainerd Taylor, Charles Grandison Finney, Lyman Beecher, Barton Stone, Alexander Campbell, Peter Cartwright and James B. Finley. Rev. Charles Finney (1792\u20131875) was a key leader of the evangelical revival movement in America. From 1821\n\nparticular site to camp, pray, sing hymns, and listen to itinerant preachers at the tabernacle. Camp meetings offered community, often singing and other music, sometimes dancing, and diversion from work. The practice was a major component of the Second Great Awakening, an evangelical movement promoted by Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and other preachers in the early 19th century. Certain denominations took the lead in different geographic areas. Camp meetings today are often held annually at campgrounds owned by a Christian denomination. The camp meeting is a phenomenon of American frontier Christianity, as well as British Christianity, but with strong roots in\n\nmany groups during the Second Great Awakening, including the Mormons, Baptists and Shakers. Several factors made the restoration sentiment particularly appealing during this time period: The Restoration Movement began during, and was greatly influenced by, the Second Great Awakening. While the leaders of one of the two primary groups making up this movement, Thomas Campbell and Alexander Campbell, resisted what they saw as the spiritual manipulation of the camp meetings, the revivals contributed to the development of the other major branch, led by Barton W. Stone. The Southern phase of the Awakening \"was an important matrix of Barton Stone's reform\n\nthe camp area, some using stumps, wagons and fallen trees as makeshift platforms. Cane Ridge Revival The Cane Ridge Revival was a large camp meeting that was held in Cane Ridge, Kentucky from August 6 to August 12 or 13, 1801.

It was based at the Cane Ridge Meeting House and drew between 10,000 and 20,000 people.

Several factors made the restoration sentiment particularly appealing during this time period. Camp meetings fueled the Second Great Awakening, which served as an \"organizing process\" that created \"a religious and educational infrastructure\" across the trans-Appalachian frontier that encompassed social networks, a religious journalism that provided mass communication, and church related colleges. The American Restoration Movement aimed to restore the church and sought \"the unification of all Christians\n\nRed River Meeting House The Red River Meeting House was the site of the first religious camp meeting in the United States. Held June 13\u201317, 1800, it marked the start of the Second Great Awakening, a major religious movement in the United States in the first part of the nineteenth century. The meeting was organized by the Presbyterian minister James McGready (also spelled M'Gready) in Logan County, Kentucky, and several preachers took part. What later became known as the Revival of 1800 began as a traditional Presbyterian sacramental occasion at the Red River Meeting House in June of the same\n\n1807 and moved to Henderson, Kentucky, to minister to a congregation he had pioneered during the 1800 revivals. He died there in 1817. Revival of 1800 The Revival of 1800 was a series of evangelical Christian meetings which began in Logan County, Kentucky, which ignited the subsequent events and influenced several of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening. The events represented a transition from traditions carried over from Europe to innovations that responded to the unique needs and personality of Americans in the new century. The startling manifestations of revival fervor that first occurred in June 1800 at the\n\nSometimes revival would be initiated by regular preaching or the customary pulpit exchanges between two ministers. Through their efforts, New England experienced a \"great and general Awakening\" between 1740 and 1743 characterized by a greater interest in religious experience, widespread emotional preaching, and intense emotional reactions accompanying conversion, including fainting and weeping. There was a greater emphasis on prayer and devotional reading, and the Puritan ideal of a converted church membership was revived. It is estimated that between 20,000 to 50,000 new members were admitted to New England's Congregational churches even as expectations for members increased. By 1745, the Awakening\n\nSecond Great Awakening The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant religious revival during the early 19th century in the United States. The movement began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800 and, after 1820, membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1850s. The Second Great Awakening reflected Romanticism characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the supernatural. It rejected the skeptical rationalism and deism of the Enlightenment. The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations.</P>\nQuestion: what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening<|eot_id|>\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAccording to the text, the purpose of a revival meeting during the Second Great Awakening was to inspire active members of a church body to gain new converts and to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings.

        "question": "Context: <P> Rodriguez in the fifth. The Astros scored one run in the sixth on Adam Everett's sacrifice bunt off of Jason Marquis and another in the seventh on Morgan Ensberg's RBI single off of Julian Tavarez. This was the final game at Busch Stadium (II). This would also be the Astros' last postseason win as a member of the NL, as they would get swept in the World Series, move to the AL in 2013, and would not win another postseason game until the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. Roy Oswalt was named the series MVP. In two starts, he\n\nField in Chicago and the final two in Houston. Game 3 marked the first World Series game held in the state of Texas, and was the longest game in World Series history, lasting 5 hours and 41 minutes. This World Series was marked by a controversy involving the Minute Maid Park roof. MLB & Commissioner Bud Selig insisted that the Astros must play with the roof open, which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros fans. In the 2006 offseason, the team signed Preston Wilson and moved Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure of Jeff Bagwell.\n\nGame 3 were Yu Darvish for the Dodgers and Lance McCullers Jr. for the Astros. The Astros scored four runs in the bottom of the second inning on a home run by Yuli Gurriel and RBIs by Gonz\u00e1lez, Brian McCann, and Bregman. Darvish left the game after innings, which was the shortest outing of his career. The Dodgers scored one run in the top of the third inning as Seager grounded into a double play after McCullers loaded the bases with three consecutive walks. The Astros added another run in the fifth on an RBI single by Evan Gattis and\n\ntwo games in St. Louis. However, the Astros tied the series in the next two games in Houston, before a combined one-hitter by Astros pitchers Brandon Backe and Brad Lidge gave them the series lead. An RBI single by Jeff Bagwell in the 9th inning of Game 6 tied the game and forced extra innings. In the 12th, Edmonds won the game for the Cardinals with a walk-off home run. Trailing in the sixth inning of Game 7, a game-tying RBI double by Albert Pujols followed by a Scott Rolen two-run home run and then an RBI single by Larry\n\n6, and 7; and the Astros hosting Games 3, 4, and 5. This was the first World Series matchup, and second postseason meeting overall, between the Astros and Dodgers. Los Angeles defeated Houston in the 1981 National League Division Series in five games en route to its World Series championship that year. The teams also met in the 1980 National League West tie-breaker game. This was the first Fall Classic since , and the eighth overall, in which both participants had 100 or more wins during the regular season. The two teams did not meet in interleague play during the\n\nof the 8th inning. While with the Astros for two years, Roger Clemens never pitched against the Rangers in twelve Lone Star Series matchups. Only four players have played for both the Rangers and Astros against their in-state opponent since 2001. Those players are: Doug Brocail, Mike Lamb, Richard Hidalgo, and Ivan \"Pudge\" Rodr\u00edguez. Minute Maid Park and Rangers Ballpark in Arlington both had been using Sea Isle 1 turf through the 2008 season rather than natural grass because of the aggressive Texas summer heat. Before the 2009 season, the Astros chose to replace the previous surface in their respective\n\nand had not been in the Series since 1959, three years before the Astros' inaugural season. Like the 1982 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers, the 2005 World Series is one of only two World Series in the modern era (1903\u2013present) with no possibility for a rematch between the two opponents, because the Astros moved to the AL in 2013. However, the Brewers did meet the Cardinals in the 2011 NL Championship Series. The Astros would return to the World Series in 2017 as an AL franchise, where they would win in seven games against\n\nfirst team from Texas to do so. It was the first time since 2001-2002 when two consecutive World Series went to seven games. Both teams set a World Series record with a combined total of 25 home runs throughout the entire series, including a team record 15 home runs by the Astros, and hit a combined total of eight home runs in Game 2 to set the single game World Series mark. Houston outfielder George Springer was named as the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after hitting five home runs in the series to tie a World Series record\n\nfan in the suburbs of St. Louis, said that as he was circling the bases after his home run, he was thinking about a similar walk-off homer by Jim Edmonds for the Cardinals in Game 6 of the 2004 National League Championship Series. After Freese said he remembered that home run, Lance Berkman, who played for the losing Houston Astros in that series, said \"So do I.\" Before Game 7, the Cardinals replaced Matt Holliday, who sprained his wrist in Game 6, on their roster with Adron Chambers. Josh Hamilton and Michael Young had RBI doubles in the first inning\n\nheld by the Astros. The roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions. For Hurricane Ike in 2008, Selig mandated that the Astros play two home games against the Chicago Cubs in his hometown of Milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting Cubs; the home ballparks for the Texas Rangers and Atlanta Braves were both available to host the games. The Astros subsequently were victims of a no-hitter by Carlos Zambrano and recorded a single hit in the following game. In the midst of the playoff race, this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race\n\nThe next major Chicago sports championship came in 2010, when the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks ended a 49-year Stanley Cup title drought. With the Chicago Bears' win in Super Bowl XX and the Chicago Cubs' own World Series championship in 2016, all Chicago sports teams have won at least one major championship since 1985. Meanwhile, the Astros themselves made it back to the World Series in 2017, but this time as an AL team, where they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, resulting in Houston's first professional sports championship since the 2006\u201307 Houston Dynamo won their back-to-back MLS Championships.\n\nrun in the bottom of the inning on an error by Reynolds at shortstop. But Astros reliever Joaqu\u00edn And\u00fajar came in and held on for the save to tie the series at 1-1. Houston's Astrodome was always known as a pitcher's park, and the domed stadium lived up to its reputation when the series moved there for Game 3. The two teams' pitching staffs combined to yield only thirteen hits and one run in the game's eleven innings. Houston's Joe Niekro pitched ten strong innings but missed out on what would have been a win, while Phillies closer Tug McGraw\n\nthe same game. Game 3 was the first World Series game played in the state of Texas. Before the game, it was ruled by Commissioner Bud Selig that the retractable roof would be open at Minute Maid Park, weather permitting. The Astros objected, citing that their record in games with the roof closed was better than with the retractable roof open. Selig's office claimed that the ruling was based on the rules established by Houston and were consistent with how the Astros organization treated the situation all year long, as well as the weather forecasts for that period of time.\n\noff Dan Miceli, sending the series to a Game 7 showdown. Thursday, October 21, 2004 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri The final, deciding Game 7 started off with Astros' leadoff man Craig Biggio smacking a home run in the game's first at-bat off Cardinals' starter Jeff Suppan to make it 1\u20130. The Astros' threat continued in the second by putting two men on, but, thanks to a tremendous catch by center fielder Jim Edmonds, the Cardinals were able to get out of the inning unscathed. In the third, however, the Astros made it 2\u20130 with Carlos Beltr\u00e1n,\n\non June 21-22 that year. The Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros were the last two teams to play each other, from June 10-12, 2005, at Minute Maid Park. With the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2032 5-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on July 10, 2013, every team has beaten every other team at least once; the A's had previously been 11-0 all time against the Pirates. Every team has also hosted and visited every other team at least once. This distinction was completed in July 2016 when the San Diego Padres made their first trip to Toronto. The two teams had previously\n\nfinal American League teams to make their first appearances in the ALDS. The Astros had been in the National League through 2012, and had played in the National League Division Series (NLDS) seven times. From 1998 to 2011, the wild card team was assigned to play the division winner with the best winning percentage (outside of their own division) in one series, and the other two division winners met in the other series. However, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record were from the same division, the wild-card team played the division winner with the\n\nwalks as the Cardinals' 6\u22124 win put them up 2\u22120 in the series heading to Houston. Saturday, October 16, 2004 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas In the first game of the series played in Houston's Minute Maid Park, the Cardinals went up 1\u22120 in the first on Larry Walker's one-out home run, but the Astros tied it in the bottom of the inning off Jeff Suppan on Lance Berkman's RBI single before Jeff Kent's two-run home run put them up 3\u22121.

In Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, Ausmus homered with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie the game at 6\u20136 and send it to extra innings; the Astros went on to win in the 18th inning, in what was the longest postseason game in history. Ausmus caught 17 innings, as well as playing 1 inning at first base.

This was the last game in which the Astros wore their \"rainbow guts\" uniform top, which the franchise introduced in 1975 and became one of the most iconic, if infamous, uniforms in MLB history. 1986 NLCS (4\u20132): New York Mets over Houston Astros Astros' pitcher Mike Scott was named the series' Most Valuable Player by going 2\u20130 with a 0.50 earned-run average, allowing just one earned run on eight hits and one walk in\n\nAstros won the National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, 3\u20131, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes).

In the bottom of the ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had\n\nLarry Walker advanced to third when the Astros failed to call timeout after the play at the plate. John Mabry ended the threat by grounding into a double play. La Russa's ejection marked the first time a manager was ejected from a postseason game since 1998, when Mike Hargrove was thrown out of a game between his Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees.

        "question": "Context: <P> sun dried natural building material made from sand, clay, water and straws shaped into bricks traditionally called \"chirpici\". Finer adobe is also used for exterior coating and as a binding material. The exterior of a house is usually covered with a layer of lime. Some houses are decorated with traditional motifs. The simple ridged roof consists of declined rafters that rest on vertical wall-plates on top of each wall. Tiles are often used as a roof covering although galvanised steel and bitumen could also be found. The roof often extends toward the front of a house to cover a small\n\ntwo rooms; a central chimney; a gable, hipped-gable or hipped roof; and plastered and limewashed exteriors. Materials used were those that could be procured locally, including wood (usually oak), mud, straw, fieldstone, lime, and animal dung. Roofs in densely wooded and hilly areas are typically clad in wooden shakes or shingles, while flatter and more open areas have traditionally used rye straw. In the late 19th century two types of construction predominated, horizontal log construction, and frame and fill construction. Log walls were common in areas where wood was available. In places with very poor timber or with an extreme\n\nis one of the oldest of building materials known, Thatch is another word for grass; grass is a good insulator and easily harvested. Many African tribes have lived in homes made completely of grasses and sand year-round. In Europe, thatch roofs on homes were once prevalent but the material fell out of favor as industrialization and improved transport increased the availability of other materials. Today, though, the practice is undergoing a revival. In the Netherlands, for instance, many new buildings have thatched roofs with special ridge tiles on top. Wood has been used as a building material for thousands of\n\nPreviously they had been constructed from wood, bamboo and a kind of straw called \"Khar\". Khar was used in the roof of the Bungalow house and kept the house cold during hot summer days. Another roofing material for Bungalow houses has been red clay tiles. In the British colonial age predominantly representative buildings of the Indo-European style developed, from a mixture of mainly Indian, European and Central Asian (Islamic) components. Amongst the more prominent works are Ahsan Manzil in Dhaka and Tajhat Palace in Rangpur City. In modern context, Bangladeshi architecture has become more diversified comprising reflections of contemporary architectural\n\nProduction of the cement was by the \u00abFor\u00bb company of which Horodecki was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a building material, so its use was employed as publicity for both the house and the building material. The House with Chimaeras was designed in such a way that the tenants would occupy the whole floor, each floor had all the necessary household rooms ranging from private kitchens to small powder rooms. The open floor\n\nMenhirs, boulders formed due the varying temperatures, were brought down from the hills with great effort by the people and installed to mark notable events of the community. These are rough in shape, huge and of considerable weight and height, and are \"free-standing\". Craftsmanship was superior during this period with finds of wheel made durable hard red ware, copper objects, and tools made of bone and stone. Structures made of rubble were also found. Finds of a few copper arrowheads indicated knowledge of metallurgy. Period IV (dated to the 3rd\u20134th century AD), the last phase of human occupation at Burzahom,\n\nupon availability of material. In vernacular architecture, roofing material is often vegetation, such as thatches, the most durable being sea grass with a life of perhaps 40 years. In many Asian countries bamboo is used both for the supporting structure and the outer layer where split bamboo stems are laid turned alternately and overlapped. In areas with an abundance of timber, wooden shingles and boards are used, while in some countries the bark of certain trees can be peeled off in thick, heavy sheets and used for roofing. The 20th century saw the manufacture of composition asphalt shingles which can\n\nor pitch to keep them weatherproof. A few oasts had square kilns with brick roofs, again covered in tar or pitch. The top of the roof was open, and carried a cowl or louvred vent. Oasts were generally built of bricks, or local stone. Bricks were the usual material for building the stowage, wood only being used in floors. Stone was sometimes used too (Madley). Some oasts had a cider mill on the ground floor of the stowage (Little Cowarne Court, Little Cowarne). Bricks were the usual material for building the kilns. Stone was also used. Kiln roofs could be\n\nused as a roofing material, was weatherproof, insulating and could last for thirty years. Houses of axe-hewn slabs with Iron-bark roofs continued to be built in rural Australia until WWII. As better tools became available the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber of the native hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed for the construction of a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. Split logs that\n\nroof was of traditional construction with two beams 24\" by 10\" in section used for strutting the rafters and hanging the ceiling. The tiles were set in a mud-like mortar on a thin timber decking. The ceiling also was made from this thin timber veneer like plywood. In spite of the houses' flexibility the subtle modular and the fine workmanship, the roof was heavy and complicated. The Tokyo modular system appeared to have been used. Horizontal distances measured between column centers were in multiples of . Vertical distances were floor to mid-transom, and thence to the ceiling, the width of\n\nlake bed. The location is in a high terrace which is part of the floodplain of the Jhelum river and has Karewa soil (clay) formation. The site has a commanding view of the Dal lake which is about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) away. In the Kashmiri language 'Burzahom' means \"birch\", a tree species (that generally grows in the elevation range of 3,000 to 4,200 metres (9,800 to 13,800\u00a0ft) in the Himalayas), which is found in the excavated housing area in the form of roofing material, and thus confirming the existence of the tree even in the pre-historic Neolithic times.\n\nthose appurtenances were all made to revolve on wooden pivots in holes, bored a short distance into the corresponding parts of the frames. Thatching was less common, but cumbungi (rushes), and blady grass were used if available. Later, when crops were grown, straw was used. For a more permanent dwelling shingles would be cut. The cabbage tree palm was found most suitable, and later the she-oak. In later years, galvanised iron became a popular roofing material, due to its cheapness and durability. Sometimes this was laid over the original shingles. Mrs Gunn noted that 'Great sheets of bark... were packed\n\nflat and were supported by mangrove poles. The poles were covered with a layer of split bamboo and a palm mat locally called \"manghrour\". The mangrove poles often extended past the exterior walls for decorative purposes. Doors were made of metal or wood. Colored glass employing geometrical designs was sometimes used in windows.

Finer adobe is also used for exterior coating and as a binding material. The exterior of a house is usually covered with a layer of lime. Some houses are decorated with traditional motifs. The simple ridged roof consists of declined rafters that rest on vertical wall-plates on top of each wall. Tiles are often used as a roof covering although galvanised steel and bitumen could also be found. The roof often extends toward the front of a house to cover a small\n\ntwo rooms; a central chimney; a gable, hipped-gable or hipped roof; and plastered and limewashed exteriors. Materials used were those that could be procured locally, including wood (usually oak), mud, straw, fieldstone, lime, and animal dung. Roofs in densely wooded and hilly areas are typically clad in wooden shakes or shingles, while flatter and more open areas have traditionally used rye straw. In the late 19th century two types of construction predominated, horizontal log construction, and frame and fill construction. Log walls were common in areas where wood was available.

Many African tribes have lived in homes made completely of grasses and sand year-round. In Europe, thatch roofs on homes were once prevalent but the material fell out of favor as industrialization and improved transport increased the availability of other materials. Today, though, the practice is undergoing a revival. In the Netherlands, for instance, many new buildings have thatched roofs with special ridge tiles on top. Wood has been used as a building material for thousands of\n\nPreviously they had been constructed from wood, bamboo and a kind of straw called \"Khar\". Khar was used in the roof of the Bungalow house and kept the house cold during hot summer days. Another roofing material for Bungalow houses has been red clay tiles. In the British colonial age predominantly representative buildings of the Indo-European style developed, from a mixture of mainly Indian, European and Central Asian (Islamic) components. Amongst the more prominent works are Ahsan Manzil in Dhaka and Tajhat Palace in Rangpur City. In modern context, Bangladeshi architecture has become more diversified comprising reflections of contemporary architectural\n\nProduction of the cement was by the \u00abFor\u00bb company of which Horodecki was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a building material, so its use was employed as publicity for both the house and the building material. The House with Chimaeras was designed in such a way that the tenants would occupy the whole floor, each floor had all the necessary household rooms ranging from private kitchens to small powder rooms. The open floor\n\nMenhirs, boulders formed due the varying temperatures, were brought down from the hills with great effort by the people and installed to mark notable events of the community. These are rough in shape, huge and of considerable weight and height, and are \"free-standing\". Craftsmanship was superior during this period with finds of wheel made durable hard red ware, copper objects, and tools made of bone and stone. Structures made of rubble were also found. Finds of a few copper arrowheads indicated knowledge of metallurgy. Period IV (dated to the 3rd\u20134th century AD), the last phase of human occupation at Burzahom,\n\nupon availability of material. In vernacular architecture, roofing material is often vegetation, such as thatches, the most durable being sea grass with a life of perhaps 40 years. In many Asian countries bamboo is used both for the supporting structure and the outer layer where split bamboo stems are laid turned alternately and overlapped. In areas with an abundance of timber, wooden shingles and boards are used, while in some countries the bark of certain trees can be peeled off in thick, heavy sheets and used for roofing. The 20th century saw the manufacture of composition asphalt shingles which can\n\nor pitch to keep them weatherproof. A few oasts had square kilns with brick roofs, again covered in tar or pitch. The top of the roof was open, and carried a cowl or louvred vent. Oasts were generally built of bricks, or local stone. Bricks were the usual material for building the stowage, wood only being used in floors. Stone was sometimes used too (Madley). Some oasts had a cider mill on the ground floor of the stowage (Little Cowarne Court, Little Cowarne). Bricks were the usual material for building the kilns. Stone was also used. Kiln roofs could be\n\nused as a roofing material, was weatherproof, insulating and could last for thirty years. Houses of axe-hewn slabs with Iron-bark roofs continued to be built in rural Australia until WWII. As better tools became available the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber of the native hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed for the construction of a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. Split logs that\n\nroof was of traditional construction with two beams 24\" by 10\" in section used for strutting the rafters and hanging the ceiling. The tiles were set in a mud-like mortar on a thin timber decking. The ceiling also was made from this thin timber veneer like plywood. In spite of the houses' flexibility the subtle modular and the fine workmanship, the roof was heavy and complicated. The Tokyo modular system appeared to have been used.

The location is in a high terrace which is part of the floodplain of the Jhelum river and has Karewa soil (clay) formation. The site has a commanding view of the Dal lake which is about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) away. In the Kashmiri language 'Burzahom' means \"birch\", a tree species (that generally grows in the elevation range of 3,000 to 4,200 metres (9,800 to 13,800\u00a0ft) in the Himalayas), which is found in the excavated housing area in the form of roofing material, and thus confirming the existence of the tree even in the pre-historic Neolithic times.\n\nthose appurtenances were all made to revolve on wooden pivots in holes, bored a short distance into the corresponding parts of the frames. Thatching was less common, but cumbungi (rushes), and blady grass were used if available. Later, when crops were grown, straw was used. For a more permanent dwelling shingles would be cut. The cabbage tree palm was found most suitable, and later the she-oak. In later years, galvanised iron became a popular roofing material, due to its cheapness and durability. Sometimes this was laid over the original shingles. Mrs Gunn noted that 'Great sheets of bark... were packed\n\nflat and were supported by mangrove poles. The poles were covered with a layer of split bamboo and a palm mat locally called \"manghrour\". The mangrove poles often extended past the exterior walls for decorative purposes.

In 1953, she sold her shares of \"Meet the Press\" and \"The Big Issue\" to Spivak for $125,000, reportedly after a coin-toss, and left her job at \"Meet the Press\". She returned to television in the summer of 1956 as the moderator of \"Press Conference\"\n\nfollowed by a roundtable discussion or one-on-two interview with figures in adversarial positions, either Congressional members from opposite sides of the aisle or political commentators. Originally a half-hour program for most of its history, the show expanded to 60 minutes starting with the September 20, 1992, broadcast. The program also features in-depth examinations of facts behind political and general news stories (particularly as part of a segment called the \"Data Download\", introduced after Chuck Todd assumed duties as moderator, which is conducted on a touchscreen within the main set). \"Meet the Press\" began on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System\n\nMartha Rountree Martha Rountree (October 23, 1911 \u2013 August 23, 1999) was an American pioneering broadcast journalist and entrepreneur.

The physical border between Herne and Recklinghausen in fact is, and has been for a long time, the bridge at the Bochumer Strasse across the Rhine-Herne Canal (the South shore of the Canal is Herne, the North shore is Recklinghausen). A little further North of the Canal flows the Emscher River, which was a major known location because\n\n\"Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks AG\" (GBAG) to provide a link to the GBAG mines of \"Rheinelbe\", \"Alma\" and \"Pluto\" as well as supplying the ironworks of 'Schalker group' with imported ore. Around the same time, and up to 1929 the industrial railway of \"Erzbahn\" was built, serving the Schalker and Bochum group iron and steelworks. Between 1937 and 1968 Grimberg harbour was one of the major ports on the canal. In 1968 steel production at the southern end of the Erzbahn at Bochum ended, in 1982 the Schalker works closed - with this the use of the port for transport of iron\n\nore ended. Such was the emphasis on iron ore that much of the port now stands empty, part of it nowadays is used for the processing of recycled materials for the building industry, as well as a storage facility. Like many other the port of Westhafen Wanne (Wanne west harbour) was originally built for the mutual benefit of the mines and canal, with a railway connecting the two.

Twelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and never changed them. From 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat drunk driving fatalities.

Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area. Historically, a few municipalities had ordinances against\n\nin 1984, which tied federal highway funds to states' maintaining a minimum drinking age of 21. Despite a rekindled national debate in 2008 on the established drinking age (initiated by several university presidents), a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in September 2008 that 76% of New Jerseyans supported leaving the legal drinking age at 21 years. No significant differences emerged when considering gender, political affiliation, or region. However, parents of younger children were more likely to support keeping the age at 21 (83%) than parents of college-age students (67%). Seventeen states (Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi,\n\n(MLDA) of 21. Between 1970 and 1975, 29 states lowered the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20. This was primarily due to the passing of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the required voting age from 21 to 18. During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote (or legally drink) were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the\n\nalcoholic beverages. However, these changes were soon followed by studies showing an increase in motor vehicle fatalities attributable to the decreased MLDA. In response to these findings, many states raised the minimum legal drinking age to 19 (and sometimes to 20 or 21). In 1984, the National Minimum Legal Drinking Act, written by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and influenced by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), required all states to enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 or else risk losing 10% of all federal highway construction funds. As the MLDA was still left to the discretion of the state,\n\nas his motivations. In 1998, the National Youth Rights Association was founded, in part, to seek to lower the drinking age back to 18. In 2004, the president of Vermont's Middlebury College, John McCardell, Jr. wrote in \"The New York Times\" that \"the 21-year-old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law\" that has made the college drinking problem far worse. Groups that oppose the 21 minimum include Choose Responsibility, the Amethyst Initiative, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Mothers Against Drunk Driving supports the 21 law and has been the main opponent to lowering it back to 18.\n\nruled the Act was constitutional and the States still had the right to set their own drinking ages. However, the Federal Government can give the state a 10% penalty on highway funds if the state chooses to have their drinking age lower than 21. Not even a year later, all 50 states of the United States officially made 21 the minimum legal drinking age. MLDA-21 is not the only variable; the shift in demographics, increased enforcement, increased seat belt use, safer cars, increased parental monitoring and \"designated driver\" emphasis could also be a reason why after the age was raised,\n\nCanada enacted prohibition of alcohol sales, consumption and distribution between the years of 1910 and 1920. After prohibition was ended, most provinces had a minimum drinking age of 21 years, while in the early 70s the age limit was lowered to either 18 or 19 years of age. Later a few provinces and territories raised their age limit from 18 to 19 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The legal age for buying and possessing (but not necessarily for drinking) has been 21 years in every state since shortly after the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act\n\nto 21 - however minors could still buy alcohol to take home until 1914 when the age for both on- and off-licence purchase was set at 21. In 1969 the purchase age was lowered from 21 to 20. (although 18-year-olds were allowed to drink in bars from 1990 on certain conditions.) But in 1999 the legal purchasing age was lowered from 20 to 18 and despite several calls and legislation to raise the drinking age again, Lawmakers have overwhelmingly favoured the status quo and the age remains 18. It has never been illegal for a minor to drink alcohol in\n\nthe State Capitol in Albany on January 4, 1984; and recessed indefinitely shortly before 2 a.m. on July 1. An hour after midnight, on May 30, the State Assembly rejected after a stormy debate of many hours the proposal to raise the legal drinking age from 19 to 21 years; the vote stood 80 to 69. The Legislature met for another special session on December 6, 1984. At this session, the legislators raised the wages of the legislators who were elected to the next Legislature; approved a sales tax increase for Erie County; and extended a corporate tax surcharge used\n\nvoluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat drunk driving fatalities. In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below).

However, as the act controlled the distribution of anywhere from $8 million to $99 million, depending on the size of the state, the act gave a strong incentive for states to change the drinking age to 21.

As one can see in the table below, there has been much volatility in the states' drinking ages since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. Shortly after the ratification of the 21st amendment in December, most states set their purchase ages at 21 since that was the voting age at the time. Most of these limits remained constant until the early 1970s. From 1969 to 1976, some 30 states lowered their purchase ages, generally to 18.

The first registered consumption age limits were imposed for the first time meaning nobody under the age of 18 could drink in a public bar and nobody under the age of 13 could buy alcohol to take home. The Licensing Act of 1881 created a minimum age of 16 to purchase alcohol in a bar, however did not impose a minimum age to purchase alcohol to be taken away.

During the Vietnam War era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an eighteen-year-old could be drafted into the military to fight in a war overseas, but could not buy a beer. Most states lowered the legal drinking age to eighteen. Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough drink-driving laws in 1980; since\n\nunderage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s. New Jersey's drinking age was lowered to 18 in 1973 as part of a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then\n\ngetting compromised away, and the group's public appearances and testimony on the issue (and some controversial newsletter articles) seemed to be insufficient. Further, a proposal to raise the state's drinking age from 18 to 21 had succeeded in getting onto state ballots, and the group, which had decided to work on the issue, had to be careful not to use state funds to do so.

Many states started to lower their minimum drinking age in response, most of this occurring in 1972 or 1973. Twelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and never changed them. From 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat drunk driving fatalities. In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose\n\nillegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area. Historically, a few municipalities had ordinances against\n\nin 1984, which tied federal highway funds to states' maintaining a minimum drinking age of 21. Despite a rekindled national debate in 2008 on the established drinking age (initiated by several university presidents), a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in September 2008 that 76% of New Jerseyans supported leaving the legal drinking age at 21 years. No significant differences emerged when considering gender, political affiliation, or region. However, parents of younger children were more likely to support keeping the age at 21 (83%) than parents of college-age students (67%). Seventeen states (Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi,\n\n(MLDA) of 21. Between 1970 and 1975, 29 states lowered the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20. This was primarily due to the passing of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the required voting age from 21 to 18. During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote (or legally drink) were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the\n\nalcoholic beverages. However, these changes were soon followed by studies showing an increase in motor vehicle fatalities attributable to the decreased MLDA. In response to these findings, many states raised the minimum legal drinking age to 19 (and sometimes to 20 or 21). In 1984, the National Minimum Legal Drinking Act, written by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and influenced by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), required all states to enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 or else risk losing 10% of all federal highway construction funds. As the MLDA was still left to the discretion of the state,\n\nas his motivations. In 1998, the National Youth Rights Association was founded, in part, to seek to lower the drinking age back to 18. In 2004, the president of Vermont's Middlebury College, John McCardell, Jr. wrote in \"The New York Times\" that \"the 21-year-old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law\" that has made the college drinking problem far worse. Groups that oppose the 21 minimum include Choose Responsibility, the Amethyst Initiative, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Mothers Against Drunk Driving supports the 21 law and has been the main opponent to lowering it back to 18.\n\nruled the Act was constitutional and the States still had the right to set their own drinking ages. However, the Federal Government can give the state a 10% penalty on highway funds if the state chooses to have their drinking age lower than 21. Not even a year later, all 50 states of the United States officially made 21 the minimum legal drinking age. MLDA-21 is not the only variable; the shift in demographics, increased enforcement, increased seat belt use, safer cars, increased parental monitoring and \"designated driver\" emphasis could also be a reason why after the age was raised,\n\nCanada enacted prohibition of alcohol sales, consumption and distribution between the years of 1910 and 1920. After prohibition was ended, most provinces had a minimum drinking age of 21 years, while in the early 70s the age limit was lowered to either 18 or 19 years of age. Later a few provinces and territories raised their age limit from 18 to 19 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The legal age for buying and possessing (but not necessarily for drinking) has been 21 years in every state since shortly after the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act\n\nto 21 - however minors could still buy alcohol to take home until 1914 when the age for both on- and off-licence purchase was set at 21. In 1969 the purchase age was lowered from 21 to 20. (although 18-year-olds were allowed to drink in bars from 1990 on certain conditions.) But in 1999 the legal purchasing age was lowered from 20 to 18 and despite several calls and legislation to raise the drinking age again, Lawmakers have overwhelmingly favoured the status quo and the age remains 18. It has never been illegal for a minor to drink alcohol in\n\nthe State Capitol in Albany on January 4, 1984; and recessed indefinitely shortly before 2 a.m. on July 1. An hour after midnight, on May 30, the State Assembly rejected after a stormy debate of many hours the proposal to raise the legal drinking age from 19 to 21 years; the vote stood 80 to 69.

He was born apparently in Venice, and was a student of Taddeo Gaddi. In 1384-87, Antonio completed the three Saint Ranieri frescoes begun by Andrea da Firenze in the Campo Santo in Pisa. Already deteriorated by time, they were severely damaged during a bombing raid in World War II. In Pisa, he worked alongside Andrea Vanni on the ceilings of the cathedral in 1370. Antonio painted the ceiling of the Capellone degli Spagnuoli in\n\nVictor by Piero di Giovanni Tedesco for the facade of the Florence cathedral. Three years later, in Florence, Lorenzo created three polylobed panels for the altar of the Madonna delle Grazie in the cathedral\u2019s nave. The panels displayed half-length images of St John the Evangelist, St. Matthew, and St. Mark. Another artist, Pesello, was responsible for the image of the Agnus Dei, which centered the canopy\u2019s vault, while Lorenzo's most significant contribution was a curtain that accompanied the image of the Virgin. This canopy has since been dismantled and Lorenzo's panels depicting the Evangelists are now housed in the Sagrestia\n\nwhile working on it was the English artist Giles Hussey. Also in Lincoln, he painted a fresco of the Ascension in the chancel and apse of the church of St Peter-at-Arches. The church was demolished in the 1930s, but Damini's oil \"modello\" for the work survives. Five decorative paintings inset into the plaster ceiling of a room designed by James Gibbs for a house in Henrietta Street, London, are attributed to Damini. The entire room, dating from around 1727-32 is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. He returned to Italy in 1730, accompanied by Giles Hussey, whom, according to\n\nPistoia, as well as the cathedral at Fiesole. Ludovico Buti Ludovico Buti (c. 1560 - after 1611) was an Italian painter, active mostly in Florence. Belonging to the late-Mannerist period, he worked along with more famous figures as Alessandro Allori, Bernardino Poccetti or Santi di Tito on large projects, including the decoration of certain ceilings of the Uffizi and the Grand Cloister of Santa Maria Novella. In 1589, the duke Ferdinando I commissioned the decoration of the \"Map Room\" and the \"Stanzino delle Matematiche\", following a design by Stefano Buonsignori. There is a fresco by Buti on the \"Annunciation\" at\n\nPapudoff and Maurocordato. Returning to Florence, he decorated the rooms for Conte Fossombroni with a design that recalled the Florentine Renaissance. He also decorated the Casino Borghesi, painting the walls in chiaroscuro and the ceiling in color. He also helped decorate the Palazzo Cecchi near the Villino Favard; the facade in graffito for the Palazzo of Prince Corsini in Corso de'Tintori; the great hall of the Villino Lemmi in Via della Scala, and in this same Villino, several ceilings in chiaroscuro, in a diversity of styles baroque, Gothic, Pompeian, and fantasy; several ceilings in the first floor of Palazzo Crispi\n\nand his family. On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of Jesus, seven prophets of Israel, and five Sibyls, prophetic women of the Classical world. Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are The Creation of Adam, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the Deluge, the Prophet Jeremiah, and the Cumaean Sibyl. In 1513, Pope Julius II died and was succeeded by Pope Leo X, the second son of Lorenzo dei Medici. Pope Leo commissioned Michelangelo to reconstruct the fa\u00e7ade of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence\n\nof the ceiling decorations. He painted an altarpiece for the Principi Chapel in the church of San Lorenzo. An artist in the court was commissioned works to celebrate the weddings of the Medici. In 1589, he was among the artists engaged in the elaborate decorations to celebrate the marriage of Ferdinando I and Cristina di Lorraine, painting the \"Defeat of Gian Galeazzo Visconti at Mantua\".

The beautiful funeral monument of Antonio d'Orso (1323), bishop of Florence, was made by Tino da Camaino, the most important funeral sculptor of his time. The monumental crucifix, behind the Bishop's Chair at the high altar, is by Benedetto da Maiano (1495\u20131497). The choir enclosure is the work of the famous Bartolommeo Bandinelli.

He was born in Forl\u00ec. He moved to Florence by 1830. In 1843, he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence. He became friends with the architect Giuseppe Poggi, and was employed in numerous restoration projects in Tuscany. He frescoed for the Palazzo Lanfranchi-Toscanelli in Pisa. In 1861, he decorated the Throne Room\n\nof The Last Judgment. This enormous work, 3,600\u00a0metres\u00b2 (38 750\u00a0ft\u00b2) of painted surface, was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579. The upper portion, near the lantern, representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators, such as Domenico Cresti, finished the other portions: (from top to bottom) Choirs of Angels; Christ, Mary and Saints; Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes; and at the bottom of the cupola: Capital Sins and Hell.  These frescoes are\n\nvarious fresco series in Florence, including one in the dome of Corsini Chapel of the Chiesa del Carmine. In the large block occupied by the former Medici palace, he painted the ceiling of the Biblioteca Riccardiana (\"Allegory of Divine Wisdom\") and the long gallery of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. The vast frescoes of the latter are contained in the 1670s gallery addition, overlooking the gardens. The planning was overseen by Alessandro Segni and commissioned by Francesco Riccardi.

The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that the ceiling was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials\n\nAntonio Veneziano (painter) Antonio Veneziano (Antonio the Venetian), was an Italian painter who was active mainly in Siena, Florence and Pisa, documented between 1369 and 1419. He was born apparently in Venice, and was a student of Taddeo Gaddi. In 1384-87, Antonio completed the three Saint Ranieri frescoes begun by Andrea da Firenze in the Campo Santo in Pisa. Already deteriorated by time, they were severely damaged during a bombing raid in World War II. In Pisa, he worked alongside Andrea Vanni on the ceilings of the cathedral in 1370. Antonio painted the ceiling of the Capellone degli Spagnuoli in\n\nVictor by Piero di Giovanni Tedesco for the facade of the Florence cathedral. Three years later, in Florence, Lorenzo created three polylobed panels for the altar of the Madonna delle Grazie in the cathedral\u2019s nave. The panels displayed half-length images of St John the Evangelist, St. Matthew, and St. Mark. Another artist, Pesello, was responsible for the image of the Agnus Dei, which centered the canopy\u2019s vault, while Lorenzo's most significant contribution was a curtain that accompanied the image of the Virgin. This canopy has since been dismantled and Lorenzo's panels depicting the Evangelists are now housed in the Sagrestia\n\nwhile working on it was the English artist Giles Hussey. Also in Lincoln, he painted a fresco of the Ascension in the chancel and apse of the church of St Peter-at-Arches. The church was demolished in the 1930s, but Damini's oil \"modello\" for the work survives. Five decorative paintings inset into the plaster ceiling of a room designed by James Gibbs for a house in Henrietta Street, London, are attributed to Damini. The entire room, dating from around 1727-32 is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. He returned to Italy in 1730, accompanied by Giles Hussey, whom, according to\n\nPistoia, as well as the cathedral at Fiesole. Ludovico Buti Ludovico Buti (c. 1560 - after 1611) was an Italian painter, active mostly in Florence. Belonging to the late-Mannerist period, he worked along with more famous figures as Alessandro Allori, Bernardino Poccetti or Santi di Tito on large projects, including the decoration of certain ceilings of the Uffizi and the Grand Cloister of Santa Maria Novella. In 1589, the duke Ferdinando I commissioned the decoration of the \"Map Room\" and the \"Stanzino delle Matematiche\", following a design by Stefano Buonsignori. There is a fresco by Buti on the \"Annunciation\" at\n\nPapudoff and Maurocordato. Returning to Florence, he decorated the rooms for Conte Fossombroni with a design that recalled the Florentine Renaissance. He also decorated the Casino Borghesi, painting the walls in chiaroscuro and the ceiling in color. He also helped decorate the Palazzo Cecchi near the Villino Favard; the facade in graffito for the Palazzo of Prince Corsini in Corso de'Tintori; the great hall of the Villino Lemmi in Via della Scala, and in this same Villino, several ceilings in chiaroscuro, in a diversity of styles baroque, Gothic, Pompeian, and fantasy; several ceilings in the first floor of Palazzo Crispi\n\nand his family. On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of Jesus, seven prophets of Israel, and five Sibyls, prophetic women of the Classical world. Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are The Creation of Adam, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the Deluge, the Prophet Jeremiah, and the Cumaean Sibyl. In 1513, Pope Julius II died and was succeeded by Pope Leo X, the second son of Lorenzo dei Medici. Pope Leo commissioned Michelangelo to reconstruct the fa\u00e7ade of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence\n\nof the ceiling decorations. He painted an altarpiece for the Principi Chapel in the church of San Lorenzo. An artist in the court was commissioned works to celebrate the weddings of the Medici. In 1589, he was among the artists engaged in the elaborate decorations to celebrate the marriage of Ferdinando I and Cristina di Lorraine, painting the \"Defeat of Gian Galeazzo Visconti at Mantua\". With Bernardo Buontalenti, he also made scenography for the Theater at the Uffizi, for the 1600 presentation of the comedy \"La Pellegrina\" and also made decorations to celebrate the wedding of Marie de' Medici to\n\ncoloring, was designed by Gaddo Gaddi in the early 14th century. Donatello designed the stained-glass window (\"Coronation of the Virgin\") in the drum of the dome (the only one that can be seen from the nave). The beautiful funeral monument of Antonio d'Orso (1323), bishop of Florence, was made by Tino da Camaino, the most important funeral sculptor of his time. The monumental crucifix, behind the Bishop's Chair at the high altar, is by Benedetto da Maiano (1495\u20131497). The choir enclosure is the work of the famous Bartolommeo Bandinelli. The ten-paneled bronze doors of the sacristy were made by Luca\n\nbecame professor in the Florentine Academy and appointed Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy. Among his other works are the following: Annibale Gatti Annibale Gatti (September, 1828 \u2013 1909) was an Italian painter, known for history painting and fresco decoration in Tuscany. He was born in Forl\u00ec. He moved to Florence by 1830. In 1843, he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence. He became friends with the architect Giuseppe Poggi, and was employed in numerous restoration projects in Tuscany. He frescoed for the Palazzo Lanfranchi-Toscanelli in Pisa. In 1861, he decorated the Throne Room\n\nof The Last Judgment. This enormous work, 3,600\u00a0metres\u00b2 (38 750\u00a0ft\u00b2) of painted surface, was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579. The upper portion, near the lantern, representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators, such as Domenico Cresti, finished the other portions: (from top to bottom) Choirs of Angels; Christ, Mary and Saints; Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes; and at the bottom of the cupola: Capital Sins and Hell.  These frescoes are\n\nvarious fresco series in Florence, including one in the dome of Corsini Chapel of the Chiesa del Carmine. In the large block occupied by the former Medici palace, he painted the ceiling of the Biblioteca Riccardiana (\"Allegory of Divine Wisdom\") and the long gallery of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. The vast frescoes of the latter are contained in the 1670s gallery addition, overlooking the gardens. The planning was overseen by Alessandro Segni and commissioned by Francesco Riccardi. They include the prototypic hagiographic celebration of the Medici family in the center, surrounded by a series of interlocking narratives: allegorical figures (the \"Cardinal\n\npainting of the ceiling in blue, studded with gilt stars, and with decorative borders around the architectural details of the pendentives. This was entirely replaced when Michelangelo came to work on the ceiling in 1508. Of the present scheme of frescos, the earliest part is that of the side walls. They are divided into three main tiers. The central tier of the walls has two cycles of paintings, which complement each other, \"The Life of Moses\" and \"The Life of Christ\". They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Cosimo\n\nSala Verde is painted in fresco by the mannerist Angelo Bronzino and includes some of his masterpieces including the Crossing the Red Sea. It was built by Tasso to be Eleonora's private chapel. It was named because of the ceiling decoration. At one time it was used for the Ladies-in-waiting at the court of Eleonora di Toledo. It contains \"Portraits of Medici Princes\" by Sustermans, statues by a Florentine art school and a tapestry by Fev\u00e8re. On the ceiling is the \"Coronation of Esther\" decorated by Stradano, with an inscription in honor of Eleonora di Toledo. The room contains a\n\nand the \"Fathers of the Church\". On the ceiling, are stories of the New Testament, including life of the Virgin, Passion of Christ, and Life of St John the Baptist, attributed to a set of Mannerist artists from Tuscany, including Casolani, Vincenzo Rustici, Orazio Porta (\"St Peter heals the sick\"), and even Poccetti himself (\"Decapitation of St John the Baptist\" and \"Saints Cosmo, Damian, Stephen, Lawrence, John the Baptist, and John the Evangelist\"). Poccetti also painted a main altarpiece for the church. Other sources add Giovanni Battista Brugieri as painting \"Ananias\" fresco.

Central to the ceiling decoration are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which \"The Creation of Adam\" is the best known, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure, and have provided an enormously influential pattern\n\nof the Ognissanti in Florence. He also painted five lunettes showing scenes from the \"Life of St Francis\" in the cloister of the Ognissanti. In 1619\u20131620 he directed the fa\u00e7ade decoration of Palazzo dell'Antella in Piazza Santa Croce of Florence. His masterpiece is said to be frescoes in the chapel of the Palazzo Rospigliosi-Pallavicini in Pistoia. While escaping Florence during the plague, he painted some frescoes in the lunettes in the Santuario della Madonna della Fontenuova in Monsummano Terme. On the left internal wall of the chorus of the church of San Bartolomeo in Cutigliano, is a canvas of Mannozzi's\n\nalso painted the altarpiece of the \"Crucifixion and St Thomas Aquinas\" (in restoration). The vestibule has quadratura painted in 1782 by the painters Grix and Stagi. The altar has walls decorated in elaborate and fine scagiole by Carlo Ghibertoni. The ceiling was decorated in 1710 with quadratura by Rinaldo Botti, and depicts the \"Glory of St Thomas\" painted by Camillo Sagrestani and Ranieri del Pace. In the seventeenth century, the oratory became a hospice for pilgrims, and in 1775, rites were suppressed. The oratory has recently been reconsecrated and holds services. Oratory of St Thomas Aquinas, Florence The Oratory of\n\nthe sanctuary wall, also by Michelangelo, wall paintings by several leading painters of the late 15th century including Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Pietro Perugino, and a set of large tapestries by Raphael, the whole illustrating much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church. Central to the ceiling decoration are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which \"The Creation of Adam\" is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vincis \"Mona Lisa\", the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both\n\nfor technical and stylistic reasons). Cimabue was subsequently commissioned to decorate the apse and the transept of the Upper Basilica of Assisi, in the same period of time that Roman artists were decorating the nave. The cycle he created there comprises scenes from the Gospels, the lives of the Virgin Mary, St Peter and St Paul. The paintings are now in poor condition because of oxidation of the brighter colours that were used by the artist. The \"Maest\u00e0 of Santa Trinita\", dated to c. 1290\u20131300, which was originally painted for the church of Santa Trinita in Florence, is now in\n\nGiambologna (16th century). The choir (or the Cappella Tornabuoni) contains another series of famous frescoes, by Domenico Ghirlandaio and his apprentice the young Michelangelo (1485\u20131490). They represent themes from the life of the Virgin and John the Baptist, situated in the Florence of the late 15th century and containing portrayals of several members of important Florentine families. The vaults are covered with paintings of the Evangelists.

Regina finds Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) while he is eating with Belle (Emilie de Ravin), and they discuss Cora; they thought her to be dead, and Regina believed she had seen her mother's body. Regina points out that Gold's feelings for Belle are now a weakness Cora can exploit, and he agrees to help prevent Cora\n\ngold, and offers to do so in exchange for her first-born child; he reveals that \"she is very important\" in the future he has seen. Cora asks Rumplestiltskin to teach her how to spin gold herself; to which he agrees and she signs his contract. Rumplestiltskin teaches Cora that magic is channeled through emotion rather than thought, and that he uses the anger he felt at being forced to kiss a man's boots in front of his son. As Cora imagines forcing the royals to bow to her, the straw changes to gold in her hands. Cora presents the gold\n\nConsequently, Cora visits Oz to bring back Zelena, who just used her magic to restock the logs she dropped. This angers her abusive adoptive father, who doesn't want Zelena to use her \u201cwicked\u201d magic. Cora immediately freezes the woodcutter as he is about to hit her (her adoptive mother wasn't around to protect Zelena this time), then gives Zelena the opportunity to prove that her magic can be used for good, which she accepts.

He agrees after she explains that the Dark One will be rendered an easily killed mortal man by the curse. His assignment is to travel to Wonderland via Jefferson's hat and kill her mother, Cora (Barbara Hershey), whom Regina previously banished to that land. She enchants his hook so that it can be used to remove Cora's heart, and no more than one heart. He is sent with the corpse of the guard he killed, so that he can bring Cora's body back in accordance\n\nSmith (Annette Badland) would try to ruin Stan and Cora's wedding day by bringing Sylvie to share a final farewell with Stan and that Shirley and Mick would reunite, before Shirley sits with Stan as he dies. Stan will also decide to bring his wedding day forward due to his short time left and they prepare to marry.

In this episode, Regina and Cora work together to keep Zelena away from Hades; and James impersonates David. In flashbacks, Cora brings Zelena to the Enchanted Forest to save Regina's life. An Underworld windmill is featured in the red-tinted forest. The Enchanted Forest events take place years after \"The Miller's Daughter\" and years before \"The Stable Boy\". The Oz events take place years after the first flashback scene of \"It's\n\nwas, a young Cora is duped by a man claiming to be a prince, and she finds herself alone and pregnant. But a chance meeting with a real prince could lead Cora to the royal life she's always craved, but she must keep her pregnancy a secret or else risk losing everything. The tornado forms in the forest. In the years before the first curse, a young bar girl named Cora is swept off her feet by a gentleman named Jonathan, who tells her that he is a prince. He makes an \"I promise you the world\"-type vow that he\n\nto live alone with her misery. On Snow White and Prince Charming's wedding day, Rumplestiltskin comes to the Evil Queen and tells her that the protection spell would lose its effect if they traveled to a different land. The Queen calls for a carriage to take her to the wedding. Cora (Barbara Hershey) and Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) moor Hook's ship in Storybrooke. Hook wants them to go their separate ways, but Cora points out that Storybrooke now has magic, and he will be unable to defeat Rumplestiltskin without her help.

When Cora finally meets Zelena, this mother-daughter reunion doesn't go smoothly as planned, and even Zelena is on to what they did with the water from the River Lethe they put the spell on, as she turns down her mother's false apology. This leads to a fight between Regina and Zelena but\n\nCora's heart, explaining that all of their problems are caused by Cora's inability to love Regina or anyone else without her heart inside her.
