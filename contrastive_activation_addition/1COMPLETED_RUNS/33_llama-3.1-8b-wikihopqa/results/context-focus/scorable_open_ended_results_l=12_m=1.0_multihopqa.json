        "question": "Context: <P> Danger: Diabolik  is a 1968 action film directed and co-written by Mario Bava, based on the Italian comic series \"Diabolik\" by Angela and Luciana Giussani. The film is about a criminal named Diabolik (John Phillip Law), who plans large-scale heists for his girlfriend Eva Kant (Marisa Mell). Diabolik is pursued by Inspector Ginko (Michel Piccoli), who blackmails the gangster Ralph Valmont (Adolfo Celi) into catching Diabolik for him. An adaptation of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi, who hired director Seth Holt and began producing the film as an international co-production with a cast that included Jean Sorel, Elsa Martinelli and Gilbert Roland. Appalled with the quality of the footage that had been shot, distributor Dino De Laurentiis took over production duties and restarted filming from scratch. Working from a new screenplay and under creative pressure from De Laurentiis, Bava directed the film on a reduced budget, with established actors taking smaller roles. The film was produced in tandem with De Laurentiis' other comic book adaptation of that year, \"Barbarella\", with both films sharing several cast and crew members. Upon its theatrical release, \"Danger: Diabolik\" performed below De Laurentiis' expectations at the box office, and received negative reviews from \"The New York Times\" and \"Variety\". With the re-evaluation of Bava's filmography, retrospective reception of the film has been more positive, with critics praising its visuals, the performances of Law and Mell, and the score by Ennio Morricone. In 2008, it was chosen by \"Empire\" magazine as one of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". A new adaptation of \"Diabolik\" by the Manetti Bros. was announced in 2018. Give It to Me or Give It 2 Me may refer to: Charge It to Me is a 1919 American silent comedy film directed by Roy William Neill and written by L.V. Jefferson.

Charge It is a 1921 American silent drama film directed by Harry Garson and starring Clara Kimball Young. Me or ME usually refers to: Me, M.E. or ME may also refer to: Point Danger or Danger Point may refer: Leave It to Me  is a 1955 Czech comedy film directed by Martin Fri\u010d. Mario Bava (31 July 1914 \u2013 27 April 1980) was an Italian cinematographer, director, special effects artist and screenwriter, frequently referred to as the \"Master of Italian Horror\" and the \"Master of the Macabre\". His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature. Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as \"Hercules\" (1958) and its sequel \"Hercules Unchained\" (1959) (each were lampooned on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\"). During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including \"I Vampiri\" (1957) (the first Italian horror film of the sound era), \"The Day the Sky Exploded\" (1958) (the first Italian science fiction film), \"Caltiki \u2013 The Immortal Monster\" (1959) and \"The Giant of Marathon\" (1959). Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres: \"Black Sunday\" (1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle; \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" (1963) is considered to be the first giallo film; \"Kill, Baby, Kill\" (1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror; \"Roy Colt & Winchester Jack\" (1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns; \" Four Times That Night\" (1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and \"A Bay of Blood\" (1971) was a precursor to slasher films. His other notable films include \"Hercules in the Haunted World\" (1961), \"Erik the Conqueror\" (1961), \"Black Sabbath\" (1963), \"The Whip and the Body\" (1963), \"Blood and Black Lace\" (1964), \"Planet of the Vampires\" (1965), \"Knives of the Avenger\" (1966),  (1968), \"Hatchet for the Honeymoon\" (1970), \"Five Dolls for an August Moon\" (1970), \"Baron Blood\" (1972), \"Lisa and the Devil\" (1974), \"Rabid Dogs\" (1974) and \"Shock\" (1977). Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava's shy, self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood. Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Joe Dante, John Landis, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright, Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino. His son and frequent assistant director, Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right. Roy William Neill (4 September 1887 \u2013 14 December 1946) was an Irish-born American film director best known for directing the last eleven of the fourteen Sherlock Holmes films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, made between 1943 and 1946 and released by Universal Studios.

        "question": "Context: <P> So Much may refer to: Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 \u2013 August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. \" Panda\" is a song of the Chilean band Astro and is the fifth song of the homonymous album of the year 2011. The song was composed and produced by the singer of the band Andr\u00e9s Nusser and released like third single of the album on February 1, 2013. Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group. Motherland may also refer to: \" Where Was I?\" may refer to: The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place. The Fools' Hall of Fame is the title of an American song. There has been more than one composition using this title. \" O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album,\" The Crane Wife\". The music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star- crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother( the singer's\" sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer. Sarre Anglo- Saxon cemetery is a place of burial that was used in the sixth and seventh centuries CE. \" There Is So Much World to See\" is a film song by Elvis Presley. It was featured in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer motion picture \"Double Trouble\" (1967). Elvis performs \"There Is So Much World to See\" to Jill Conway (Annette Day), while she is sitting on the bed.

Joseph Chamberlain (8 July 1836 \u2013 2 July 1914) was a British statesman who was first a radical Liberal, then, after opposing home rule for Ireland, a Liberal Unionist, and eventually served as a leading imperialist in coalition with the Conservatives. He split both major British parties in the course of his career. Chamberlain made his career in Birmingham, first as a manufacturer of screws and then as a notable mayor of the city. He was a radical Liberal Party member and an opponent of the Elementary Education Act 1870 on the basis that it could result in subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money. As a self-made businessman, he had never attended university and had contempt for the aristocracy. He entered the House of Commons at 39 years of age, relatively late in life compared to politicians from more privileged backgrounds. Rising to power through his influence with the Liberal grassroots organisation, he served as President of the Board of Trade in Gladstone's Second Government (1880\u201385). At the time, Chamberlain was notable for his attacks on the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury, and in the 1885 general election he proposed the \"Unauthorised Programme\", which was not enacted, of benefits for newly enfranchised agricultural labourers, including the slogan promising \"three acres and a cow\". Chamberlain resigned from Gladstone's Third Government in 1886 in opposition to Irish Home Rule. He helped to engineer a Liberal Party split and became a Liberal Unionist, a party which included a bloc of MPs based in and around Birmingham. From the 1895 general election the Liberal Unionists were in coalition with the Conservative Party, under Chamberlain's former opponent Lord Salisbury. In that government Chamberlain promoted the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897. He served as Secretary of State for the Colonies, promoting a variety of schemes to build up the Empire in Asia, Africa, and the West Indies. He had major responsibility for causing the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902) in South Africa and was the government minister most responsible for the war effort. He became a dominant figure in the Unionist Government's re-election at the \"Khaki Election\" in 1900. In 1903, he resigned from the Cabinet to campaign for tariff reform (i.e. taxes on imports as opposed to the existing policy of free trade with no tariffs). He obtained the support of most Unionist MPs for this stance, but the Unionists suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 general election. Shortly after public celebrations of his 70th birthday in Birmingham, he was disabled by a stroke, ending his public career. Despite never becoming Prime Minister, he was one of the most important British politicians of his day, as well as a renowned orator and municipal reformer. Historian David Nicholls notes that his personality was not attractive: he was arrogant and ruthless and much hated. He never succeeded in his grand ambitions. However, he was a highly proficient grassroots organizer of democratic instincts, and played the central role in winning the Second Boer War. He is most famous for setting the agenda of British colonial, foreign, tariff and municipal policies, and for deeply splitting both major political parties.

Rhescuporis II was king of half of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace from 12 to 18, in succession to his brother Rhoemetalces I, and briefly ruler of the entire realm thereafter, usurping the other half from nephew Cotys VIII. He was a son of the earlier Thracian king Cotys VI and the younger brother of kings Cotys VII and Rhoemetalces I. The Roman Historian Tacitus describes his character as \"treacherous\". On the death of Rhoemetalces, Emperor Augustus divided Thrace into two separate kingdoms, one half for Cotys VIII to rule and the other half for Rhescuporis II. Tacitus states that Cotys received the cultivated parts, most towns and most Greek cities of Thrace, while Rhescuporis received the wild and savage portion with enemies on its frontier. Rhescuporis wanted to annex Cotys\u2019 kingdom, but was prevented from doing so from fear of Augustus. Augustus' death in 14 emboldened him, and he initiated efforts to obtain the remainder of Thrace, at first by negotiation, but afterwards, when Cotys proved resistant, by treachery. Inviting his nephew to a banquet to falsely ratify a treaty between them, he arrested and imprisoned Cotys, seizing his kingdom. Cotys died while incarcerated in 18, allegedly by suicide. His wife and children fled Thrace to Cyzicus to escape Rhescuporis. The Roman Emperor Tiberius opened an investigation into Cotys\u2019 death, putting Rhescuporis on trial in the Roman Senate. He invited Cotys' widow Tryphaena to testify at the trial, during which she accused the defendant of murdering her husband. Rhescuporis was found guilty, and Tiberius sent him to live in exile in Alexandria, Egypt. En route, Rhescuporis tried to escape and was killed by Roman soldiers. His son, who would later rule Thrace as Rhoemetalces III, was spared by Tiberius and allowed to return to Thrace. In the meantime Tiberius returned the whole Thracian Kingdom to Tryphaena and appointed Rhoemetalces II, her eldest child with Cotys, as coruler. Tiberius Julius Rhescuporis IV, also known as Rhescuporis IV( flourished 3rd century \u2013 died 235) was a prince and Roman Client King of the Bosporan Kingdom. Rhescuporis IV was the second born son to the Bosporan King Cotys III and his mother was an unnamed Sarmatian noble woman. He was of Greek, Iranian and Roman ancestry. He had two brothers: one oldest called Sauromates III and a younger called Ininthimeus. Rhescuporis IV was named in honor of his paternal uncle previous Bosporan King Rhescuporis II and his paternal cousin, previous Bosporan King Rhescuporis III, who co-ruled with his father, Rhescuporis II. Rhescuporis IV in 233 succeeded Sauromates III after his death. His first brother was first co-ruler in the reign of their father Cotys III. Rhescuporis IV was co-ruler with Cotys III, until he died in 235.

H\u00fcma Hatun (1410 \u2012 September 1449) was the fourth wife of Ottoman Sultan Murad II and mother of Mehmed II and the grandmother of Bayezid II. Rhoemetalces I was king of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace from 12 BC to 12 AD, in succession to his nephew Rhescuporis I. Rhoemetalces I was a loyal ally to the first Roman Emperor Augustus. He was a direct descendant of the Thracian King Cotys I, and the middle son of the earlier Thracian king Cotys IV. His younger brother was Rhescuporis II. When Cotys VII died about 48 BC Rhoemetalces became the guardian of his nephew Rhescuporis I, his brother's young son and heir. Rhescuporis I died in 13 BC, when he was defeated and slain in battle by Vologases, chief of the Thracian Bessi, who was a leader in the revolt against the Romans in that year. During this revolt Rhoemetalces and his family fled Thrace, returning only when it ended, when Augustus returned the kingdom to his family. As Rhescuporis I had left no heir, Rhoemetalces became King of Thrace in 12 BC. The Roman Historian Tacitus, describes him as \u2018 attractive and civilized \u2019. His wife and the mother of his heir, known only through numismatic evidence, was Queen Pythodoris[ I]. Rhoemetalces I ruled Thrace until his death in 12. Augustus then divided his realm into two separate kingdoms, one half for his son Cotys VIII to rule and the other half for Rhoemetalces's remaining brother Rhescuporis II. Tacitus states that Cotys received the cultivated parts, most towns and most Greek cities of Thrace, while Rhescuporis received the wild and savage portion with enemies on its frontier.

Rhoemetalces II and Tryphaena succeeded his paternal great- uncle Rhescuporis II, who had usurped the throne from Rhoemetalces II's father Cotys VIII. The Roman Emperor Tiberius deposed Rhescuporis II and installed Rhoemetalces II and Tryphaena on the throne in his place. They served as loyal client rulers, even in 26 putting down Thracian malcontents for Tiberius. Rhoemetalces II never married and had no children. After his death in 38, his cousin Rhoemetalces III, the son of Rhescuporis II, was appointed king, while his mother retired to live as a private citizen in Cyzicus.

Judy Garland (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10, 1922 \u2013 June 22, 1969) was an American actress, singer and dancer. During a career that spanned 45 years, she attained international stardom as an actress in both musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist, and on the concert stage. Respected for her versatility, she received an Academy Juvenile Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Special Tony Award. In 1962, Garland won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for her 1961 double LP live recording \"Judy at Carnegie Hall\"\u2014the first woman to win in this category. She is considered by many to be one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century. Garland began performing in vaudeville as a child with her two elder sisters and was later signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager. She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM, and is best remembered for her portrayal of Dorothy Gale in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Garland was a frequent on-screen partner of both Mickey Rooney and Gene Kelly and regularly collaborated with director and second husband Vincente Minnelli. Some of her film appearances during this period include roles in \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (1944), \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946), \"Easter Parade\" (1948), and \"Summer Stock\" (1950). Garland was released from MGM in 1950, after 15 years with the studio, amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract. Although her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed performances came late in her career: she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in \"A Star Is Born\" (1954) and a nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums, and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963\u20131964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 1999, the American Film Institute placed her among the 10 greatest female stars of classic American cinema. Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from her teens onward; her self-image was influenced and constantly criticized by film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive. Those same executives manipulated her onscreen physical appearance. Throughout her adulthood she was plagued by alcohol and substance abuse, as well as financial instability; she often owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. Her lifelong addiction to drugs, including alcohol, ultimately led to her death in London from an accidental barbiturate overdose at age 47. A Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow (Cailin Deas Cr\u00faite na mB\u00f3 in the Irish language) is a traditional 18th-century Irish ballad. The English version is attributed to Thomas Moore (1779\u20131852). Originally sung in Irish Gaelic, the song was popular through the early 20th century. It enjoyed a revival when an updated swing version sung by Irish-American singer/actress Judy Garland was featured in the 1940 film Little Nellie Kelly. The updated version is true to the original musical air, and incorporated original lyrics by MGM Musical Director Roger Edens,\nand featured Garland singing the song to George Murphy using some of the original Gaelic lyrics in the first chorus, which was true to the traditional air, before moving into an up-tempo swing version typical of the era. The song was released as the B-side of the more popular Garland song It's A Great Day for the Irish by Decca Records in 1940. It became a popular song for Irish-Americans during St Patrick's Day celebrations. It remained a popular number for Garland throughout her career, and most notably she sang it live in its original Irish language version in July 1951 at her Theatre Royal concerts in Dublin, Ireland. A Dublin review stated: \"Remember the song she sang in \"Nellie KellyThe Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow.\" Judy is providing herself with the Irish version \u2013 \"Cailin Deas Cruidte na mBo\" while in Ireland\". Later in 1951, she included the song in her first record-breaking appearance at New York's Palace Theatre, although this time reverting to the new version that combined both English- and Irish-language lyrics. The song is also featured on Garland at the Grove on Capitol Records, recorded live in 1958 at the Coconut Grove in Hollywood. Singers and groups including Bing Crosby, Ruby Murray, Eileen Barton, Carmel Quinn, Clannad, The Fureys, Blackthorn Ceilidh Band, Runa and The Chieftains, Altan among others, have recorded the song in either form or a combination of both. Duck Baker recorded a fingerstyle guitar arrangement. The song was sung by Jack Jones the teenage son of Anne Jones the publican of the Glenrowan Inn (Victoria, Australia) while it was under siege by the Kelly Gang. The siege was broken by the Victorian Police on the morning of Monday June 28, 1880. Jack Jones died of injuries sustained during the police assault on the hotel. This song was cover-versioned by Japanese singer Suzuki Tsunekichi (Japanese: \u9234\u6728\u5e38\u5409) in the title of \"Memories\" (Japanese: \u601d\u3072\u3067), which was adapted as the opening theme song of Japanese TV drama \"Shinya Shokud\u014d\"(Japanese: \u6df1\u591c\u98df\u5802). </P>\nQuestion: When did the performer of song A Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow die?",

The film is considered to be a mockbuster of the film \"The Da Vinci Code\", and both films were released within the same month. The Da Vinci Code is a 2006 American mystery thriller film, directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman, based on Dan Brown's 2003 best- selling novel of the same name. The first in the\" Robert Langdon\" film series, the film stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Sir Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany.

In the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an investigation. A noted British Grail historian named Sir Leigh Teabing tells them that the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in Leonardo da Vinci's wall painting,\" The Last Supper\". Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within Opus Dei, an actual prelature of the Holy See, who wish to keep the true Grail a secret to prevent the destruction of Christianity. The film, like the book, was considered controversial. It was met with especially harsh criticism by the Catholic Church for the accusation that it is behind a two- thousand- year- old cover- up concerning what the Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married and that the union produced a daughter, as well as its treatment of the organizations Priory of Sion and Opus Dei. Many members urged the laity to boycott the film. In the book, Dan Brown states that the Priory of Sion and\" all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\" The film grossed$ 224 million in its worldwide opening weekend and a total of$ 758 million worldwide, becoming the second- highest- grossing film of 2006. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was followed by two sequels,\" Angels& Demons\"( 2009) and\" Inferno\"( 2016). </P>\nQuestion: Did the movies Pony Express (Film) and The Da Vinci Code (Film), originate from the same country?",

He was the second son of and became the successor to his father, Akbar II, upon his death on 28 September 1837. He was a nominal Emperor, as the Mughal Empire existed in name only and his authority was limited only to the walled city of Old Delhi (Shahjahanbad). Following his involvement in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British exiled him to Rangoon in British-controlled Burma (now in Myanmar), after convicting him on several charges. Zafar's father, Akbar II had been imprisoned by the British and he was not his father's preferred choice as his successor. One of Akbar Shah's queens, Mumtaz Begum, pressured him to declare her son, Mirza Jahangir, as his successor. However, The East India Company exiled Jahangir after he attacked their resident, in the Red Fort, paving the way for Zafar to assume the throne.

Mirza Faiz Muhammad, also known by his title of Az\u0101dud Daulah, was an Indian nobleman and official in the Mughal empire during the 18th century. He was a descendant of Mirza Hadi Baig and the great- great grandfather of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' \"Travel Journal\" provides important information about Socrates' youth. Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, from which Socrates has become renowned for his contributions to the fields of ethics and epistemology. It is this who lends his name to the concepts of Socratic irony and the Socratic method, or \"elenchus.\" However, questions remain regarding the distinction between the real-life Socrates and Plato's portrayal of Socrates in his dialogues.

Ashes and Diamonds( Polish: Popi\u00f3\u0142 i diament) is a 1958 Polish drama film directed by Andrzej Wajda, based on the 1948 novel by Polish writer Jerzy Andrzejewski. Starring Zbigniew Cybulski and Ewa Krzy\u017cewska, it completed Wajda's war films trilogy, following\" A Generation\"( 1954) and\" Kanal\"( 1956). The action of\" Ashes and Diamonds\" takes place in 1945, shortly after World War II. The main protagonist of the film, former Home Army soldier Maciek Che\u0142micki, is acting in the anti-Communist underground. Maciek receives an order to kill Szczuka, the local secretary of the Polish Workers' Party. Over time, Che\u0142micki increasingly doubts if his task is worth doing. \" Ashes and Diamonds\", although based on the novel which directly supported the postwar Communist system in Poland, was subtly modified in comparison with the source material. Wajda sympathized with the soldiers of the Polish independence underground; thus, he devoted most of the attention to Che\u0142micki. During the three- month development of\" Ashes and Diamonds\", the director made drastic changes to the baseline scenario, thanks to his assistant director Janusz Morgenstern, as well as Cybulski, who played the leading role. The film received permission from the authorities to be distributed only through Andrzejewski's intercession. The film did not receive permission to be screened at the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival. However,\" Ashes and Diamonds\" appeared at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI award. At first,\" Ashes and Diamonds\" met positive critical reception, both in Poland and worldwide. However, after the Revolutions of 1989, it was criticized for falsifying the collective memory of Polish partisans. Nevertheless, the film maintained the reputation of one of the most famous Polish motion pictures in history.

Eclipse of Reason is a 1987 anti-abortion documentary video directed, filmed, and narrated by Bernard Nathanson, with an introduction by Charlton Heston. \" Eclipse of Reason\" is a follow up to Nathanson\u2019s first film \"The Silent Scream\". The film is perhaps most known for its controversial depiction of a dilation and evacuation (D&E) abortion. The subject matter of this film focuses more on the moral implications of abortion. It served as Nathanson\u2019s call to the women of the world to end the practice of abortion. This film, as well as \"The Silent Scream\", was instrumental in the Right to Life Committee's garnering the attention of the United States public regarding the issue of abortion. \"Eclipse of Reason\" represented the argument that the fetus is human, and therefore abortion is murder. The film also serves to combat critics to \"The Silent Scream\" who argue that, although Nathanson claimed the film relied only on imagery and not pejorative speech, the film was heavily reliant on upon the language of the narrator. Therefore, \"Eclipse of Reason\" delivers the same message that abortion is murder, with similar imagery as its predecessor \"The Silent Scream\"; however, to avoid the previous appropriation of language over imagery \"Eclipse of Reason\" asks it viewers to consider reason rather than using emotionally charged narration.

The Academy and the Emmys, under pressure from Agoglia's boycott, eventually relented and cancelled the deal with ABC. The Emmys returned to the previous agreement, in which the award show was broadcast on each of the four broadcast networks on a rotating basic each year. Agoglia rejoined the executive committee of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 1994 after the deal with ABC was ended. On June 17, 1997, Agoglia announced his decision to retire from NBC.

Of Hasan ibn Ali's twenty sons, seven participated in the battle, among them Beshr ibn Hasan. All but one brother was killed during the battle. In his account of their deaths, Shahrashub writes on Beshr:\" ... and it has been said that Beshr has been martyred, too.\" Among Beshr ibn Hasan's brothers who were present at the event of Ashura were Amrobne Hasan( who was killed in the event at Karbala when he was a child), Hasan ibn Hasan( who was famously known as' Hasan Muthanna'), Qasim ibn Hasan( who was also considered to be one of the martyrs of Karbala), Abdullah ibn Hasan( Abdullah Asghar). Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (624\u2013670 CE), sometimes spelled Hasan or Hassan, was the eldest son of Ali and Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, and was the older brother of Husayn. Muslims respect him as a grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Among Shia Muslims, Hasan is revered as the second Imam. Hasan was elected for the caliphate after his father's death, but abdicated after six or seven months to Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty to end the First Fitna. Al-Hasan was known for donating to the poor, his kindness to the poor and bondmen, and for his knowledge, tolerance and bravery. For the rest of his life, Hasan lived in Medina, until he died at the age of 45 and was buried in the Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Medina. His wife, Ja'da bint al-Ash'at, is commonly accused of having poisoned him. Abdullah ibn Unais was a companion( Sahaba) of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. He participated in several military campaigns ordered by Muhammad. The first was to kill Khaled bin Sufyan Al- Hathali who belonged to the Banu Lahyan tribe at the time of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Muhammad alleged that he was planning on attacking Madinah and inciting the people of Nakhla and Uranah to attack him. Therefore he sent Abdullah ibn Unais to assassinate him in 625 during the Expedition of Abdullah Ibn Unais. Abdullah ibn Unais found Hudayr in the company of his wife, when asked about his identity. Unais replied:\" I am an arab tribesman who has heard of you and the Army you are raising to fight Muhammad, so i have come to join your ranks\" Then Muhammad sent him on the Expedition of Al Raji. Some men requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam, but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah who wanted revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan by Muhammad's followers Fadl ibn Abbas( 611-639) was a brother of Abdullah ibn Abbas and was a cousin of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

He was the son of Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton, and brother- in- law of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn. Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester,( born Alice Christabel Montagu Douglas Scott; 25 December 1901 \u2013 29 October 2004) was the wife of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the third son of King George V and Queen Mary. She was the mother of Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The daughter of the 7th Duke of Buccleuch, Scotland's largest landowner, she became by marriage a princess of the United Kingdom, and a sister- in- law to Edward VIII and George VI. She was thus an aunt by marriage to Elizabeth II. Princess Alice was extremely well travelled, both before and after her marriage. Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (Henry Frederick; 7 November 1745 \u2013 18 September 1790) was the sixth child and fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III. His 1771 marriage to a commoner against the King's wishes prompted the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 . Ann Elliot( 16 November 1743 \u2013 30 May 1769) was a British courtesan and actress. She appeared in comedies in London and Dublin. She had relationships with her mentor Arthur Murphy, with Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol and with Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland. Anne, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn( n\u00e9e Anne Luttrell, later Horton; 24 January 1743 \u2013 28 December 1808) was a member of the British Royal Family, the wife of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn. Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (\u2013 8 February 1772) was Princess of Wales by marriage to Frederick, Prince of Wales. She was one of only four Princesses of Wales who never became queen consort, as her eldest son succeeded her father-in-law as George III of the United Kingdom in 1760 rather than her spouse, who had died nine years earlier. Augusta was presumptive regent of Great Britain in the event of a regency between the death of her spouse in 1751, until the majority of her son in 1756, though in the event her father-in-law, George II, lived until 1760. Lavinia Jannetta Horton Ryves, n\u00e9e Lavinia Serres( 16 March 1797 \u2013 7 December 1871), was a British woman claiming to be a member of the British royal family, calling herself\" Princess Lavinia of Cumberland\". Born in Liverpool, England, Lavinia was the daughter of Olivia Serres and John Thomas Serres. Olivia Serres gained notoriety by claiming to be the daughter of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, a younger brother of King George III of the United Kingdom. In 1822 Lavinia married Anthony Ryves, a portrait painter. They were divorced in 1841. In 1844\" Princess Lavinia\" tried to take Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington to court for having\" overlooked\", as George III's executor, a bequest of \u00a3 15,000 to Olivia. In 1850 Lavinia published a pamphlet requesting financial aid from Queen Victoria. In 1866, aged sixty- nine, Princess Lavinia asked the Court of Probate to declare her the legitimate granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland and award her the \u00a3 15,000 bequest\" left\" by George III. In the process of the 1866 trial, Lavinia produced several remarkable documents attesting to her claims, and a handwriting expert testified to the authenticity of George III's and James Wilmot's signatures. Testimony was introduced that in fact the Duke of Kent had supported Olivia financially, and had spoken of Olivia as\" my cousin Serres\", apparently believing her story. The trial was most considered remarkable, perhaps, for the claims made by Dr. Walter Smith, Lavinia's barrister, that George III had been privately married to a Quaker, Hannah Lightfoot, and that in consequence thereof, neither George IV nor Queen Victoria had any right to the throne. Lavinia's case, however, quickly ran into difficulties: in some of the submitted documents, George III had\" signed\" his name as\" George Guelph\"; in others, William Pitt and Lord Brook had\" signed\" as earls before they had in fact become earls. The court found that Lavinia was the legitimate daughter of John and Olivia Serres and was not the granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland. The court did not prosecute Lavinia for forgery: Lavinia maintained she believed in good faith that the documents left her by Olivia were genuine. It is thought that the documents were in fact forged at the behest of Olivia, rather than Lavinia, perhaps by William FitzClarence, Olivia's boyfriend, who had calligraphic talents. Lavinia continued to write pamphlets in support of her claims, and her case was reheard by the House of Lords. She died with her claims unrecognized.
