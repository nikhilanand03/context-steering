who wrote most of the declaration of independance	<P> Political maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision . On June 11 , 1776 , Congress appointed a `` Committee of Five '' to draft a declaration , consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts , Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania , Thomas Jefferson of Virginia , Robert R. Livingston of New York , and Roger Sherman of Connecticut . The committee left no minutes , so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded ; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams , too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable -- although their accounts are frequently cited . What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft . The committee in general , and Jefferson in particular , thought that Adams should write the document , but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally . Considering Congress 's busy schedule , Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days , and likely wrote the draft quickly . He then consulted the others and made some changes , and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations . The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28 , 1776 . The title of the document was `` A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America , in General Congress assembled . '' </P>	['Thomas Jefferson']	Thomas Jefferson

who discovered the atom and in what year	<P> In the early 1800s , John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers ( the law of multiple proportions ) . For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88.1 % tin and 11.9 % oxygen and the other is 78.7 % tin and 21.3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms . In the case of tin oxides , one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms . </P>	['John Dalton', 'early 1800s']	John Dalton
creating appropriation bills falls under which power of congress	<P> According to the Origination Clause of the United States Constitution , all bills for raising revenue , generally tax bills , must originate in the House of Representatives , similar to the Westminster system requirement that all money bills originate in the lower house .

how many inches is the iphone 5s screen	<P> As of 2015 -- 16 , there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4 - inch screen size of iPhone 5S , which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4 - inch iPhones in 2015 , even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7 / 5.5 - inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014 . Furthermore , the 5 and 5S design was regarded as `` long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general '' ( with the 5S 's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5 's already well - regarded look ) , while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it `` felt a little bit wrong , as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap '' . The iPhone 5 was described as `` elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together . It felt streamlined , yet substantial , which is different from iPhone 6 , which feels substantial in size alone . Plus , unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6 , iPhone 5 did n't really look like anything else on the market at the time '' . However , the iPhone 5 / 5S design was not suited to scaling up , in contrast to the iPhone 6 / 6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6 / 6S Plus phablet models . When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S , it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE 's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly . </P>	['4 in ( 10 cm )']	4 in ( 10 cm )

who gave the famous objective co relative theory	<P> The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative . </P>	['T.S. Eliot']	T.S. Eliot

Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford , Manchester , England , leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat - trick in South Africa 's first and second innings , both taken on 28 May 1912 . He completed both hat - tricks by dismissing South Africa 's Tommy Ward . Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat - trick : Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble ( two years apart , between the same teams at the same ground ) , Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram ( just over a week apart , in consecutive matches between the same teams ) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad . Three players have taken a hat - trick on their Test debut : English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930 , New Zealand off - spinner Peter Petherick in 1976 , and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994 . Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat - trick , taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career . During the match in which he took his hat - trick , Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match . Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat - trick on his birthday , and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat - trick in the same Test match . </P>	['Jimmy Matthews']	Jimmy Matthews

who was the first signatory of the israeli declaration of independence	<P> As leader of the Yishuv , David Ben - Gurion was the first person to sign . The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of Moetzet HaAm . However , twelve members could not attend , eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad . The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign , leaving spaces for those absent . Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner , Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column , leading to speculation that Vilner 's name had been left alone to isolate him , or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration . However , Warhaftig later denied this , stating that a space had been left for him ( as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem ) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically , but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father 's memory and so moved down two spaces . He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories , and remained close for the rest of their lives . Of the signatories , two were women ( Golda Meir ( Meyerson / Myerson ) and Rachel Cohen - Kagan ) . </P>	['David Ben - Gurion']	David Ben - Gurion

who started the tradition of coloring easter eggs	<P> Easter eggs , also called Paschal eggs , are decorated eggs that are usually used as gifts on the occasion of Easter . As such , Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide ( Easter season ) . The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs , but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in colourful foil , hand - carved wooden eggs , or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate . However , real eggs continue to be used in Eastern European tradition . Although eggs , in general , were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth , in Christianity , for the celebration of Eastertide , Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus , from which Jesus resurrected . In addition , one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red `` in memory of the blood of Christ , shed as at that time of his crucifixion . '' This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia , and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches , and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches . This Christian use of eggs may have been influenced by practices in `` pre-dynastic period in Egypt , as well as amid the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete '' . </P>	['early Christians of Mesopotamia']	early Christians of Mesopotamia
why was hong kong important to the british empire	<P> The stability , security , and predictability of British law and government enabled Hong Kong to flourish as a centre for international trade . In the colony 's first decade , the revenue from the opium trade was a key source of government funds . The importance of opium reduced over time , but the colonial government was dependent on its revenues until the Japanese occupation in 1941 . Although the largest businesses in the early colony were operated by British , American , and other expatriates , Chinese workers provided the bulk of the manpower to build a new port city . </P>	['a centre for international trade']	a centre for international trade
where does cleavage of the peptide bond by chymotrypsin occur	<P> Chymotrypsin ( EC 3.4. 21.1 , chymotrypsins A and B , alpha - chymar ophth , avazyme , chymar , chymotest , enzeon , quimar , quimotrase , alpha - chymar , alpha - chymotrypsin A , alpha - chymotrypsin ) is a digestive enzyme component of pancreatic juice acting in the duodenum where it performs proteolysis , the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides . Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side - chain of the amino acid N - terminal to the scissile amide bond ( the P position ) is a large hydrophobic amino acid ( tyrosine , tryptophan , and phenylalanine ) . These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a ' hydrophobic pocket ' ( the S position ) of the enzyme . It is activated in the presence of trypsin . The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P sidechain and the enzyme S binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme . Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates , particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P position . </P>	['positions 14 - 15 , 146 - 147 and 148 - 149']	positions 14 - 15 , 146 - 147 and 148 - 149

when did the crucifix become the symbol of christianity	<P> During the first two centuries of Christianity , the cross was rare in Christian iconography , as it depicts a purposely painful and gruesome method of public execution and Christians were reluctant to use it . A symbol similar to the cross , the staurogram , was used to abbreviate the Greek word for cross in very early New Testament manuscripts such as P66 , P45 and P75 , almost like a nomen sacrum ( nomina sacra ) . The extensive adoption of the cross as Christian iconographic symbol arose from the 4th century . </P>	['4th century']	4th century

Examples of exocrine glands include sweat , salivary , mammary , ceruminous , lacrimal , sebaceous , and mucous . Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body , the other being endocrine glands , which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream . The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands ; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products -- bile and pancreatic juice -- into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts , and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream . </P>	['bloodstream']	bloodstream

christmas though a christian holiday began as a celebration of	<P> Many popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus ' birth , with certain elements having origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated around the winter solstice by pagan populations who were later converted to Christianity . These elements , including the Yule log from Yule and gift giving from Saturnalia , became syncretized into Christmas over the centuries . The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday 's inception , ranging from a sometimes raucous , drunken , carnival - like state in the Middle Ages , to a tamer family - oriented and children - centered theme introduced in a 19th - century transformation . In fact , the celebration of Christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain Protestant groups , such as the Puritans , due to concerns that it was too pagan or unbiblical .

where did the beer hall putsch take place	<P> The Beer Hall Putsch , also known as the Munich Putsch , and , in German , as the Hitlerputsch , Hitler - Ludendorff - Putsch , Bürgerbräu - Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle , was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) leader Adolf Hitler -- along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders -- to seize power in Munich , Bavaria , during 8 -- 9 November 1923 . About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich , where they confronted the police , which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers . Hitler was not wounded during the clash , although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner - Richter who , when he was shot and killed , pulled Hitler to the pavement with him .

who said beware of the ides of march	<P> In modern times , the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC . Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate . As many as 60 conspirators , led by Brutus and Cassius , were involved . According to Plutarch , a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March .

a type of basic rock popular in the 1980s	<P> By the late 1960s `` classic rock '' period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , raga rock , and jazz - rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped - down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock / post-punk and synth - pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s . </P>	['alternative rock']	alternative rock

where did the rulers of the qing dynasty originate	<P> The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria . In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing `` Banners '' , military - social units that included Jurchen , Han Chinese , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity , which he renamed as the Manchus . By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism . They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus . They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories . </P>	['Manchuria']	Manchuria

what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries	<P> The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe , known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle , the falx messoria , was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos ' who is also youngest of Titans ( also known as God of Harvest ) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons . To illustrate this , Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe , from an ancient Italian cameo . The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe . According to Jack Herer and `` Flesh of The Gods '' ( Emboden , W.A. , Jr. , Praeger Press , NY , 1974 . ) ; the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe . </P>	['scythe']	scythe

what was the ancient chinese umbrella used for	<P> The Chinese character for umbrella is 傘 ( sǎn ) and is a pictograph resembling the modern umbrella in design . Some investigators have supposed that its invention was first created by tying large leaves to bough - like ribs ( the branching out parts of an umbrella ) .

However , the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air , hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high - ranking ( though not necessarily royalty ) in China . On at least one occasion , twenty - four umbrellas were carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting . The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun . The Chinese design was later brought to Japan via Korea and also introduced to Persia and the Western world via the Silk Road . The Chinese and Japanese traditional parasol , often used near temples , remains similar to the original ancient Chinese design . </P>	['a defense against rain']	a defense against rain

criminal minds what episode does jj find out she pregnant	<P> In `` The Crossing '' , JJ told Will that she was pregnant with his child . He later asked her to marry him , and indicated that he was willing to give up his detective 's shield in order to help take care of the baby and allow JJ to continue to do her job , though he was worried about her safety and the safety of their child . JJ later told Hotch she had found a temporary replacement for the duration of her maternity leave , and soon after gave birth to a baby boy named Henry . Will transfers to the MPDC , and the family live together in Washington . In later seasons , toddler Henry is portrayed by actress A.J. Cook 's real - life son Mekhai Andersen . JJ and Will named Reid and Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia as Henry 's godparents . When JJ returned from maternity leave , she and Will had exchanged rings with Henry 's birthstone , but did not seem to be officially engaged , as she wore her ring on her right hand , not the left . In the season seven finale , JJ tearfully asked Will to propose to her again , and they married the following evening in a small ceremony in David Rossi 's backyard . </P>	['The Crossing']	The Crossing

who plays the dragon queen from game of thrones	<P> Daenerys Targaryen ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Emilia Clarke . Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution . After she receives too many complaints about her dragons , Daenerys , locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon . Meanwhile , Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy , a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied . She considers freeing her dragons , but they attempt to attack her , making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her . After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy , Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive , but Barristan tells her of the Mad King 's actions against his enemies , which included burning them with wildfire while laughing . He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial , and she agrees with him . Mossador goes against her wishes , and kills the captive Son of the Harpy . Daenerys has him publicly executed , which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves . At night , Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned , but when she tries to touch his face , he flies away . Soon afterward , a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway . The Unsullied head in to investigate , but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy . The Unsullied attempt to fight back , but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them . Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help , killing many of the Sons of the Harpy , but gets badly wounded , and dies . Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries . Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan , and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses . She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward . The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal , and he and Viserion eat him . Daenerys then has all the lords arrested , including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq , whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles . To respect the culture of the region , she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated ( she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport ) . Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition . Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed , and gets up to leave , but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them . This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont , who is trying to win over Daenerys ' favor after being banished . Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away , but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift , and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys . After a round of questioning , Daenerys banishes Jorah once again , but takes Tyrion on as her adviser . On the great opening of Daznak 's Pit , Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena , but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life . Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy , who appear in legions and attack Daenerys ' guards . Cornered at the midst of the arena , defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns , killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears . Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back , riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd . She roams the Great Steppe north of the city , where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food . Strolling about on her own , Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers , and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail , she is surrounded . In season 6 , the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak , where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo 's former wife . Out of respect for Dothraki traditions , they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen , which consisted of the wives of deceased khals . Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside . She emerges unscathed , and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader . She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons . In the aftermath , Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron . Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne , names Tyrion as her hand , but breaks up with Daario , ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver 's Bay in her absence . With her new army , Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros . In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle , annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire . Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone , seeing him as a friend and ally , insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal . She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass ( obsidian ) from her land . When Jon 's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them , and is devastated when the Night King kills one . On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love . </P>	['Emilia Clarke']	Emilia Clarke

where did the british empire control an entire continent	<P> Since 1718 , transportation to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain , with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic . Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia . The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 . The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold , mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria , making its capital Melbourne for a time the richest city in the world and the second largest city ( after London ) in the British Empire . </P>	['Australia']	Australia

what is mercy mercy me by marvin gaye about	<P> `` Mercy Mercy Me ( The Ecology ) '' was the second single from Marvin Gaye 's 1971 album , What 's Going On . Following the breakthrough of the title track 's success , the song , written solely by Gaye , became regarded as one of popular music 's most poignant anthems of sorrow regarding the environment . Led by Gaye playing piano , strings conducted by Paul Riser and David Van De Pitte , multi-tracking vocals from Gaye and The Andantes , multiple background instruments provided by The Funk Brothers and a leading sax solo by Wild Bill Moore , the song rose to number 4 on Billboard 's Pop Singles chart and number one for two weeks on the R&B Singles charts on August 14 through to August 27 , 1971 . The distinctive percussive sound heard on the track was a wood block struck by a rubber mallet , drenched in studio reverb . The song also brought Gaye one of his rare appearances on the Adult Contemporary chart , where it peaked at number 34 . In Canada , `` Mercy Mercy Me '' spent two weeks at number 9 . </P>	['the environment']	the environment

when was the cat and mouse act introduced	<P> The Prisoners ( Temporary Discharge for Ill Health ) Act , commonly referred to as the Cat and Mouse Act , was an Act of Parliament passed in Britain under Herbert Henry Asquith 's Liberal government in 1913 . Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges . The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat 's habit of playing with its prey ( a mouse ) before finishing it off . </P>	['1913']	1913

where did they live in sex and the city	<P> Set and filmed in New York City and based on the 1997 book of the same name by Candace Bushnell , the show follows the lives of a group of four women -- three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties -- who , despite their different natures and ever - changing sex lives , remain inseparable and confide in each other . Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) , Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life -- from sex to relationships -- through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . </P>	['New York City']	New York City

the most common form of megalithic architecture in europe is	<P> The most common type of megalithic construction in Europe is the portal tomb -- a chamber consisting of upright stones ( orthostats ) with one or more large flat capstones forming a roof .

The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe , in particular Skorba Temples .

what nfl team has the most expensive super bowl ring	<P> These rings are typically made of yellow or white gold with diamonds . They usually include the team name , team logo , and Super Bowl number ( usually indicated in Roman numerals ) . The NFL contributes up to $5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for o the winning team ; any additional costs are borne by the team . Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens . In 2015 , the rings for the New England Patriots reportedly cost $36,500 each , making them the most expensive rings Jostens has ever produced . The winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose , including usually , but not limited to : players ( active roster or injured ) , coaches , trainers , executives , personnel , and general staff . Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season , despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself . Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle . Teams can distribute any number of rings . A recent trend over the last 15 -- 20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff . These are commonly called `` B '' and `` C '' level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds . The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones ( which resemble diamonds ) . When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII , the players and coaches received rings with a diamond - centered Lombardi trophy . Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy and real diamonds surrounding the trophy and the `` C '' level ring did not contain any diamonds . </P>	['New England Patriots']	New England Patriots

when did the usa join world war one	<P> The American entry into World War I came in April 1917 , after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war . Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general .

when did university stop being free in australia	<P> In 1989 , the Hawke Labor Government began gradually re-introducing fees for university study . It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme ( HECS ) , which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University , Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins ( see Dawkins Revolution ) . Under the original HECS , a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students , and the Commonwealth paid the balance . A student could defer payment of this HECS amount ( in which case it was called a HECS debt ) and repay the debt through the tax system , when the student 's income exceeds a threshold level . As part of the reforms , Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means . The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today , though with a number of changes . </P>	['1989']	1989

when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma	<P> The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . </P>	['1940']	1940

who translated the play neel darpan into english	<P> James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators . His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' . This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements . </P>	['Reverend J. Long']	Reverend J. Long

when was christmas first celebrated as a holiday	<P> Although the month and date of Jesus ' birth are unknown , by the early - to - mid fourth century the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25 , a date that was later adopted in the East . Today , most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar , which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world . However , some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar , the day after the Western Christian Church celebrates the Epiphany . This is not a disagreement over the date of Christmas as such , but rather a preference of which calendar should be used to determine the day that is December 25 . Moreover , for Christians , the belief that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity , rather than the exact birth date , is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas . </P>	['336']	336

why does cooling water run through the condenser	<P> Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine . Condensers use relatively cool water , via various means , to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines . This reduces the back pressure , which in turn reduces the steam consumption , and thus the fuel consumption , while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler - water . However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 . While water usage is not an issue with marine engines , it forms a significant limitation for many land - based systems . </P>	['condense the steam']	condense the steam
when does a cell have condensed visible chromosomes also known as sister chromatids	<P> Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division ( where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form ) . Before this happens , every chromosome is copied once ( S phase ) , and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere , resulting either in an X-shaped structure ( pictured to the right ) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two - arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends . The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids . During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome . In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study . In animal cells , chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during segregation . </P>	['metaphase']	metaphase

what was the purpose of the bantu education act	<P> The Bantu Education Act , 1953 ( Act No. 47 of 1953 ; later renamed the Black Education Act , 1953 ) was a South African segregation law which legalised several aspects of the apartheid system . Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities . Even universities were made `` tribal '' , and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools . Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans . In 1959 , this type of education was extended to `` non white '' universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act , and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system . It is often argued that the policy of Bantu ( African ) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market , although Hendrik Verwoerd , at the time Minister of Native Affairs , claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa 's `` ethnic problems '' by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups . </P>	['legalised several aspects of the apartheid system']	legalised several aspects of the apartheid system

who cracked the enigma code in world war 2	<P> During the Second World War , Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC&CS ) at Bletchley Park , Britain 's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence . For a time he led Hut 8 , the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis . Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers , including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine . Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements , including the Battle of the Atlantic , and in so doing helped win the war . Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war , but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives . </P>	['Turing']	Turing

when was the last time unc did not make the ncaa tournament	<P> Guthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to Matt Doherty , the head coach at Notre Dame and a player on the 1982 championship team , to lead the Tar Heels . Doherty had little success while at North Carolina . In his first season , the Heels were ranked # 1 in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with a 26 -- 7 record . But Doherty 's second season was the worst in recent history as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8 -- 20 , missing postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965 -- 66 season ( including a record 27 straight NCAA Tournament appearances ) and finishing with a losing record for the first time since 1962 ( Dean Smith 's first year as coach ) . They also finished 4 -- 12 in the ACC -- only the program 's second losing ACC record ever . The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play , and placed them in a tie for 7th place -- the program 's first finish below fourth place ever . The season also saw the end of UNC 's run of 31 straight 20 - win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC . After bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002 -- 2003 season , the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25 . North Carolina went on to finish the season 17 -- 15 , missing the NCAA tournament . Matt Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT , where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown . </P>	['2003']	2003

where was the outlaw of josey wales filmed	<P> Principal photography began on October 6 , 1975 in Lake Powell . A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming . Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail , which caused disagreements with Eastwood , not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman 's part in regards to their emerging relationship . One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself . From then on , the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second - in - command , but with Kaufman 's planning already in place , the team were able to finish making the film efficiently . </P>	['Utah', 'Arizona', 'Wyoming', 'Oroville , California']	Utah

Accordingly , large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a king cobra . The toxins affect the victim 's central nervous system , resulting in severe pain , blurred vision , vertigo , drowsiness , and eventually paralysis . If the envenomation is serious , it progresses to cardiovascular collapse , and the victim falls into a coma . Death soon follows due to respiratory failure .

who came up with the term baby boomer	<P> The phrase baby boom refers to a noticeable increase in the birth rate . The post-war population increase was described as a `` boom '' by various newspaper reporters , including Sylvia F.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the first recorded use of `` baby boomer '' is from 1970 in an article in The Washington Post . Various authors have delimited the baby boom period differently . Landon Jones , in his book Great Expectations : America and the Baby Boom Generation ( 1980 ) , defined the span of the baby - boom generation as extending from 1943 through 1960 , when annual births increased over 4,000,000 . Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe , well known for their generational theory , define the social generation of Boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960 , who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II , but old enough to remember the postwar American High . </P>	['The Washington Post']	The Washington Post

who picks the players in the nfl draft	<P> The NFL Scouting Combine is a six - day assessment of skills occurring every year in late February or early March in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis , Indiana . College football players perform physical and mental tests in front of NFL coaches , general managers , and scouts . With increasing interest in the NFL draft , the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance , allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting . Its origins have evolved from the National , BLESTO , and Quadra Scouting services in 1977 to the media frenzy it has become today . Athletes attend by invitation only . Implications of one 's performance during the Combine can affect perception , draft status , salary , and ultimately his career . The draft has popularized the term `` Workout Warrior '' ( sometimes known as a `` Workout Wonder '' ) , describing an athlete who , based on superior measurables such as size , speed , and strength , has increased his `` draft stock '' despite having a possibly average or subpar college career . </P>	['each team']	each team

Marshall at Sutter 's Mill in Coloma , California . The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad . The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy , and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory , in the Compromise of 1850 . The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease , genocide and starvation .

who wrote the first declaration of human rights	<P> The Cylinder 's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus ' policy of the repatriation of the Jewish people following their Babylonian captivity ( an act that the Book of Ezra attributes to Cyrus ) , as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples . This interpretation has been disputed , as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries , and makes no mention of Jews , Jerusalem , or Judea . The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights , a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder 's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign . Neil MacGregor , Director of the British Museum , has stated that the cylinder was `` the first attempt we know about running a society , a state with different nationalities and faiths -- a new kind of statecraft . '' It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire . On October 14 , the Mohammad Reza Shah 's sister , Princess Ashraf Pahlavi , presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder .

what is the first step in the evolution of the eye	<P> The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation . </P>	['eyespots']	eyespots

when was the first documented case of tool mark identification	<P> The ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century . By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . </P>	['1835']	1835

when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils	<P> As a technique for drawing , the closest predecesor to the pencil was Silverpoint until in 1565 ( some sources say as early as 1500 ) , a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish , Cumbria , England . This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid , and it could easily be sawn into sticks . It remains the only large - scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form . Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead . Consequently , it was called plumbago ( Latin for `` lead ore '' ) . Because the pencil core is still referred to as `` lead '' , or a `` lead '' , many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead , and the black core of pencils is still referred to as lead , even though it never contained the element lead . The words for pencil in German ( bleistift ) , Irish ( peann luaidhe ) , Arabic ( قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ ) , and some other languages literally mean lead pen . </P>	['never contained the element lead']	never contained the element lead
where can you find dna in the body	<P> Within eukaryotic cells , DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes . During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication , providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes . Eukaryotic organisms ( animals , plants , fungi and protists ) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles , such as mitochondria or chloroplasts . In contrast prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm . Within the eukaryotic chromosomes , chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA . These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins , helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed . </P>	['chromosomes in a cell']	chromosomes in a cell

which site of an enzyme is called allosteric site	<P> A regulatory site ( also known as an `` allosteric site '' ) is a site on an allosteric protein to which a modulator molecule ( or allosteric regulator ) binds . This ligand - binding site on a receptor or enzyme is distinct from the active site . Allosteric modulators alter enzyme activity by binding to the regulatory site . Some allosteric regulators activate enzymes , while others inhibit them . The working hypothesis is that when allosteric regulators bind to the regulatory site , the protein undergoes conformational changes which changes the enzyme 's activity . </P>	['regulatory site']	regulatory site

The word `` Toyopet ( Japanese article ) '' was a nickname given to the Toyota SA due to its small size , as the result of a naming contest the Toyota Company organized in 1947 . However , when Toyota eventually entered the American market in 1957 with the Crown , the name was not well received due to connotations of toys and pets . The name was soon dropped for the American market , but continued in other markets until the mid-1960s . </P>	['1957']	1957

what was the first video game for nintendo	<P> Their first video arcade game was 1975 's EVR Race ; a handful of others followed in the next several years , Radar Scope and Donkey Kong being among the most famous of these . The early 1980s saw Nintendo 's video game division ( led by Yokoi ) creating some of its most famous arcade titles . The massively popular Donkey Kong was created in 1981 , with Shigeru Miyamoto as its mastermind , and released in the arcades and on the Atari 2600 , Intellivision , and ColecoVision video game systems ( although Nintendo themselves generally had no involvement with these early console ports ) . This release method would be used on several later Nintendo arcade games of this same period , including the original Mario Bros. ( not to be confused with the later Super Mario Bros . ) In addition to this arcade and dedicated console game activity , Nintendo was testing the consumer handheld video game waters with the Game & Watch . </P>	['EVR Race']	EVR Race

when was the minimum wage established in the united states	<P> In 1910 , in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League , the Women 's Trade Union League ( WTLU ) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts . Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not . However , the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws , considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees . </P>	['1933']	1933

For example : the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain , and www is a label to create www.example.com , a subdomain of example.com . Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets . The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot . The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation . Thus , when using a single character per label , the limit is 127 levels : 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253 . In practice , some domain registries may have shorter limits . </Li> <Li> A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address . For example , the domain names www.example.com and example.com are also hostnames , whereas the com domain is not . However , other top - level domains , particularly country code top - level domains , may indeed have an IP address , and if so , they are also hostnames . </Li> <Li> Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name .

what is a real world application of an atwood machine	<P> An elevator with a counterbalance approximates an ideal Atwood machine and thereby relieves the driving motor from the load of holding the elevator cab -- it has to overcome only weight difference and inertia of the two masses .

Ski lifts are another example , where the gondolas move on a closed ( continuous ) pulley system up and down the mountain . The ski lift is similar to the counter-weighted elevator , but with a constraining force provided by the cable in the vertical dimension thereby achieving work in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions .

To do this , each of them attempt to find the best transport solution : May buys a Mercedes - Benz Estate and modifies it by fitting a Perspex tank filled with sea water in which to keep the fish alive ; Clarkson buys a Nissan Hardbody truck which he fits with a generator and an ice machine in an attempt to keep the fish frozen and Hammond buys a TVS Star motorcycle and devises a rack which he fits to the bike 's rear , inspired by a local method of drying and salting the fish to preserve them . After unsuccessfully trying to catch fish using local methods , they buy fish at a local market . Early in the journey , Clarkson 's truck crashes into May 's car upon rescuing it , damaging its radiator grille . Deeper into rural Mozambique , May constantly soaks himself with sea water from his ill - fitted tank and , due to his damaged radiator grille , suffers multiple breakdowns due to water intrusion . Hammond loses a large number of his fish on the bumpy roads , constantly gets stuck in thick mud and endlessly falls from his motorbike . Clarkson suffers very few issues except when his ice machine breaks , causing him to make small adjustments to his truck in order to smoke the fish with his exhaust . Upon May 's car breaking down in the middle of a lake , despite Hammond and Clarkson crossing successfully , Clarkson cuts off the front end of the Mercedes and tows what remains of the rear portion using his truck - much to May 's dismay and annoyance . Eventually , the three reach Bingo with May 's fish dead , Clarkson 's fish ruined and Hammond having almost no fish left . As a result , they sell no fish and leave Bingo in a helicopter `` like all charitable celebrities '' . </Td> </Tr> </Table>"	['Abbie Eaton', 'Kevin Pietersen', 'Brian Wilson']	Abbie Eaton

who painted the ceiling of the florence cathedral	<P> It was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre ( 147 ft ) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern . Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue . All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system . </P>	['Giorgio Vasari', 'Federico Zuccari']	Giorgio Vasari

which is the lion's mane jellyfish's species within its genus	<P> The lion 's mane jellyfish ( Cyanea capillata ) , also known as the giant jellyfish or the hair jelly , is the largest known species of jellyfish . Its range is confined to cold , boreal waters of the Arctic , northern Atlantic , and northern Pacific Oceans . It is common in the English Channel , Irish Sea , North Sea and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and Øresund . It may also drift in to the south - western part of the Baltic Sea ( where it can not breed due to the low salinity ) . Similar jellyfish -- which may be the same species -- are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand . The largest recorded specimen found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870 , had a bell with a diameter of 2.3 metres ( 7 ft 6 in ) and tentacles 37.0 m ( 121.4 ft ) long . Lion 's mane jellyfish have been observed below 42 ° N latitude for some time in the larger bays of the east coast of the United States . </P>	['C. capillata']	C. capillata

who did the central powers defeat on the eastern front before concentrating back on france	<P> The military convention between Bulgaria and the Central Powers laid down the general plan for its campaign against the Kingdom of Serbia . It severely limited the control of the Bulgarian High Command over the Bulgarian 1st Army , which was designated part of a combined German , Bulgarian and Austro - Hungarian force commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen . He had recently led the German and Austro - Hungarian armies in the highly successful and victorious Gorlice -- Tarnów Offensive of the Central Powers against the Russian army on the Eastern Front . His army group was created specifically to wage war against the Serbian army in the pre-1913 borders of the country ( `` Old Serbia '' ) , to defeat it wherever it found it and to open the land route between Hungary and Bulgaria . As commander , Mackensen acted independently and received his directives only from the German High Command . However , the field marshal 's orders to his Bulgarian forces had to be relayed to the commander of the 1st Army by the Bulgarian General Staff , which left room for the latter to intervene when needed . According to the convention , the Bulgarian commander - in - chief retained full and direct control over the Bulgarian 2nd Army and its operations in Vardar Macedonia . </P>	['the Russian army']	the Russian army

when did the term sustainability start to be used	<P> In 1987 the United Nation 's World Commission on Environment and Development ( the Brundtland Commission ) , in its report Our Common Future suggested that development was acceptable , but it must be sustainable development that would meet the needs of the poor while not increasing environmental problems . Humanity 's demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption . In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand ; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations . A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling , and renewable energies emerged . The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and ' 80s , primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity , presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation , the first large - scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and ' 90s .

when did the first train run in england	<P> The railway system of Great Britain , the principal territory of the United Kingdom , is the oldest in the world . It was started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in 1560s . The system was later built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies in late 18th century . These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network , although still run by dozens of competing companies . Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained ( see railway mania ) . The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed . However , the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network . In 1923 , almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the `` big four '' , the Great Western Railway , the London and North Eastern Railway , the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway . The `` Big Four '' were joint - stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947 . </P>	['1804']	1804

who is the book of acts written to	<P> Luke -- Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem , namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church ; the answer it provides , and its central theme , is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it .

On the one hand Luke portrays the Christians as a sect of the Jews , and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion ; on the other , Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians , celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God 's promised Messiah . </P>	['Jewish audiences']	Jewish audiences

who said the poison is in the dose	<P> `` The dose makes the poison '' ( Latin : sola dosis facit venenum ) is an adage intended to indicate a basic principle of toxicology .

'' This is often condensed to : `` The dose makes the poison '' or in Latin , `` Sola dosis facit venenum '' . It means that a substance can produce the harmful effect associated with its toxic properties only if it reaches a susceptible biological system within the body in a high enough concentration ( i.e. , dose ) . </P>	['Paracelsus']	Paracelsus

who conducted the opening concert at carnegie hall	<P> Carnegie Hall is named after Andrew Carnegie , who funded its construction . It was intended as a venue for the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society , on whose boards Carnegie served . Construction began in 1890 , and was carried out by Isaac A. Hopper and Company . Although the building was in use from April 1891 , the official opening night was May 5 , with a concert conducted by maestro Walter Damrosch and great Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky . Originally known simply as `` Music Hall '' ( the words `` Music Hall founded by Andrew Carnegie '' still appear on the façade above the marquee ) , the hall was renamed Carnegie Hall in 1893 after board members of the Music Hall Company of New York ( the hall 's original governing body ) persuaded Carnegie to allow the use of his name . Several alterations were made to the building between 1893 and 1896 , including the addition of two towers of artists ' studios , and alterations to the smaller auditorium on the building 's lower level . </P>	['Walter Damrosch', 'Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky']	Walter Damrosch
where did students for a democratic society start	<P> SDS developed from the Student League for Industrial Democracy ( SLID ) , the youth branch of a socialist educational organization known as the League for Industrial Democracy ( LID ) . LID descended from the Intercollegiate Socialist Society , started in 1905 . Early in 1960 , the SLID changed its name into SDS at the behest of its then acting Director , Aryeh Neier . The phrase `` industrial democracy '' sounded too narrow and too labor oriented , making it more difficult to recruit students . Moreover , because the LID 's leadership did not correspond to the expectations and the mood on the campuses , the SLID felt the need to dissociate itself from its parent organization . SDS held its first meeting in 1960 on the University of Michigan campus at Ann Arbor , Michigan , where Alan Haber was elected president . Its political manifesto , known as the Port Huron Statement , was adopted at the organization 's first convention in 1962 , based on an earlier draft by staff member Tom Hayden . </P>	['Ann Arbor , Michigan']	Ann Arbor , Michigan

Haji Sahib was permitted to enter British controlled territory for the ceremony and spent the night in the ' Pokh ' Mosque of Tehkal . At the foundation stone laying ceremony , Sir Roos Keppel and other British officials were present , so Haji Sahib hid his face in his sheet ( Chadar ) from them and was led by Sheikh Muhammad Ibrahim to the place where he was to lay the foundation stone .

who did us fight in world war 1	<P> In 1917 , with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war , and with Britain and France low on credit , Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe , while the Ottoman Empire clung to its possessions in the Middle East . In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 . On December 7 , 1917 , the U.S. declared war on Austria - Hungary . U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918 . </P>	['Germany']	Germany
rain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called	<P> Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic , meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions ( low pH ) . It can have harmful effects on plants , aquatic animals and infrastructure .

Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results . Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes , and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions . Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests , freshwaters and soils , killing insect and aquatic life - forms , causing paint to peel , corrosion of steel structures such as bridges , and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health . </P>	['Acid rain']	Acid rain

who commissioned the first christmas card in 1943	<P> The first Christmas cards were commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and illustrated by John Callcott Horsley in London on 1st May 1843 . The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card 's recipient : on either side were scenes of charity , with food and clothing being given to the poor . Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial , but the idea was shrewd : Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier . Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each . </P>	['Sir Henry Cole']	Sir Henry Cole
when did they start adding zinc to pennies	<P> In 1943 , at the peak of World War II , zinc - coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper . A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from the 1942 planchets remaining in the bins . Similarly , some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed . From 1944 through 1946 , salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process , and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues . </P>	['1864']	1864

what is the most popular religion in sweden	<P> The Lutheran Church of Sweden -- which was the state religion until 2000 -- has a registered membership of 6.1 million Swedish citizens , equal to 61.2 % of the total population . One reason for the high membership might be the fact that until 1996 all newborns with at least one parent being a member of the Church of Sweden were also registered as members of the church . Yet the membership is declining rapidly , about 1 % each year , falling from 95 % in 1970 and 85 % in 2000 . </P>	['Lutheran']	Lutheran
who is the current defence against the dark arts teacher	<P> Defence Against the Dark Arts , commonly shortened to D.A.D.A. , is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts , and to be protected from Dark creatures . In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , with Death - Eaters in charge of the school , the subject is renamed the Dark Arts , and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse on those who have earned detentions . The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members -- throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year . Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject . During the period the story takes place , the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell ( book one ) , Gilderoy Lockhart ( book two ) , Remus Lupin ( book three ) , Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor `` Mad - eye '' Moody ( book four ) , Dolores Umbridge ( book five ) , Severus Snape ( book six ) , and Amycus Carrow ( book seven ) . Hagrid suggests in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that `` They 're startin ' ter think the job 's jinxed . No one 's lasted long for a while now . '' In Half - Blood Prince , Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected . The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling . The position had also been coveted by Snape , but he was denied the position as well . Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half - Blood Prince . Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died , the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue , set nineteen years afterwards . Furthermore , she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject . </P>	['Amycus Carrow']	Amycus Carrow
who decides where the super bowl is played	<P> The NFL owners meet to make a selection on the site , usually three to five years prior to the event . In 2007 , NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London , perhaps at Wembley Stadium . The game has never been played in a region that lacks an NFL franchise ; seven Super Bowls have been played in Los Angeles , but none were held there in the 21 - year period when the league had no team in the area . New Orleans , the site of the 2013 Super Bowl , invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game . </P>	['the NFL']	the NFL

who is in charge of ratifying treaties in the us	<P> Treaty power is a co-ordinated effort between the Executive branch and the Senate . The President may form and negotiate , but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a two - thirds vote in the Senate . Only after the Senate approves the treaty can the President ratify it . Once it is ratified , it becomes binding on all the states under the Supremacy Clause . While the House of Representatives does not vote on it at all , the requirement for the Senate 's advice and consent to ratification makes it considerably more difficult to rally enough political support for international treaties . Also , if implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds , the House of Representatives may be able to block or at least impede such implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds . </P>	['the Senate', 'the President']	the Senate

who came up with popcorn at the movies	<P> During the Great Depression , popcorn was fairly inexpensive at 5 -- 10 cents a bag and became popular . Thus , while other businesses failed , the popcorn business thrived and became a source of income for many struggling farmers , including the Redenbacher family , namesake of the famous popcorn brand . During World War II , sugar rations diminished candy production , and Americans compensated by eating three times as much popcorn as they had before . The snack was popular at theaters , much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners , who thought it distracted from the films . Their minds eventually changed , however , and in 1938 a Midwestern theater owner named Glen W. Dickson installed popcorn machines in the lobbies of his theaters . The venture was a financial success , and the trend soon spread . </P>	['Glen W. Dickson']	Glen W. Dickson
what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body	<P> About two thirds of the total body water of humans is held in the cells , mostly in the cytosol , and the remainder is found in the extracellular compartment . The extracellular fluids may be divided into three types : interstitial fluid in the `` interstitial compartment '' ( surrounding tissue cells and bathing them in a solution of nutrients and other chemicals ) , blood plasma and lymph in the `` intravascular compartment '' ( inside the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels ) , and small amounts of transcellular fluid such as ocular and cerebrospinal fluids in the `` transcellular compartment '' . The interstitial and intravascular compartments readily exchange water and solutes but the third extracellular compartment , the transcellular , is thought of as separate from the other two and not in dynamic equilibrium with them . </P>	['interstitial', 'intravascular', 'transcellular']	interstitial
what emperor took over france after the reign of terror	<P> External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars . </P>	['Napoleon']	Napoleon

where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading	<P> Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year . </P>	['volcanic activity']	volcanic activity

the removal of temperature in fire fighting method is known as	<P> One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water . The water has two roles : It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire , and this vapor displaces the oxygen ( the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water , at 1,000 ° F ( 538 ° C ) it expands over 4,000 times ) . This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent , and it dies out . The vaporization of water also absorbs heat ; it thereby cools the smoke , air , walls , and objects that could act as further fuel , and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow , which is by `` jumping '' to nearby heat / fuel sources to start new fires , which then combine . Water extinguishment is thus a combination of `` asphyxia '' ( cutting off the oxygen supply ) and cooling . The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia , but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area . </P>	['cooling']	cooling

ganglion axons forming the optic nerve run to the	<P> The optic nerve leaves the orbit ( eye socket ) via the optic canal , running postero - medially towards the optic chiasm , where there is a partial decussation ( crossing ) of fibres from the temporal visual fields ( the nasal hemi - retina ) of both eyes . The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species , and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species . Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex , while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements . Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep - wake cycle . Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space . The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe , 24 mm in the orbit , 9 mm in the optic canal , and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm . There , partial decussation occurs , and about 53 % of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts .

where did the battle of bonhomme richard take place	<P> On 23 September 1779 , the squadron encountered the Baltic Fleet of 41 sail under convoy of the HMS Serapis and HM hired armed vessel Countess of Scarborough near Flamborough Head . The Bonhomme Richard and Serapis entered a bitter engagement at about 6 : 00 p.m. The battle continued for the next four hours , costing the lives of nearly half of the American and British crews . British victory seemed inevitable , as the more heavily armed Serapis used its firepower to rake Bonhomme Richard with devastating effect . The commander of the Serapis finally called on Jones to surrender . He replied , `` Sir , I have not yet begun to fight ! '' Jones eventually managed to lash the ships together , nullifying his opponent 's greater maneuverability and allowing him to take advantage of the larger size and considerably more numerous crew of Bonhomme Richard . An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed , as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard . Finally , after another of Jones 's ships joined the fight , the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10 : 30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard -- shattered , on fire , leaking badly -- defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11 : 00 a.m. on Saturday , 25 September 1779 .

what are the four main types of precipitation	<P> In meteorology , precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity . The main forms of precipitation include drizzle , rain , sleet , snow , graupel and hail . Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor , so that the water condenses and `` precipitates '' . Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air . Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud . Short , intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called `` showers .

who says that which we call a rose	<P> `` A rose by any other name would smell as sweet '' is a popular reference to William Shakespeare 's play Romeo and Juliet , in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family 's rival house of Montague , that is , that he is named `` Montague '' . The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are . This formulation is , however , a paraphrase of Shakespeare 's actual language . Juliet compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he was not named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet 's love . This states that if he was not Romeo , then he would not be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all . </P>	['Juliet']	Juliet
who proposed the first accurate model of dna	<P> The deciphering of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 suggested that each strand of the double helix would serve as a template for synthesis of a new strand .

which type of fire detector uses the effect of smoke on a light source and photo-electric cell	<P> A photoelectric , or optical smoke detector contains a source of infrared , visible , or ultraviolet light ( typically an incandescent light bulb or light - emitting diode ) , a lens , and a photoelectric receiver ( typically a photodiode ) . In spot - type detectors all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air , which may contain smoke from a nearby fire , flows . In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums , optical beam or projected - beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit : a wall - mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device , or reflected back to the receiver by a reflector . In some types , particularly optical beam types , the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor . The received light intensity will be reduced due to scattering from particulates of smoke , air - borne dust , or other substances ; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold , potentially due to smoke . In other types , typically chamber types , the light is not directed at the sensor , which is not illuminated in the absence of particles . If the air in the chamber contains particles ( smoke or dust ) , the light is scattered and some of it reaches the sensor , triggering the alarm . </P>	['optical smoke detector']	optical smoke detector

Spending several days on the ship , Burnham is ordered by its captain , the mysterious Gabriel Lorca , to assist with a scientific assignment . Burnham overhears Lieutenant Paul Stamets , an astromycologist who is leading the assignment , discuss an upcoming experiment with a colleague serving on another starship ; Lorca is soon informed of an incident on the Discovery 's sister ship , the USS Glenn , that has killed the entire crew . Stamets leads a boarding party to investigate and finds the dead crew hideously twisted and malformed , as well as a group of Klingons killed by an unknown creature . Lorca later asks Burnham to work for him , despite her sentence , explaining that he organized the circumstances that led her to him so she could help develop a new spore - based propulsion system that could win the war she started by killing T'Kuvma .

Stamets is reluctant to make such a long jump using the spores , and when the drive is activated the ship nearly collides with a star . Lorca sends Commander Landry to keep Burnham 's research on track , and she attempts to sedate the Tardigrade ( that she names Ripper ) to cut off its claw ; it kills her . Burnham believes that Ripper was acting in self - defense , and is drawn to the spores . Stamets and Burnham transport it to Engineering , where it connects to the spore drive and interfaces with the navigation system .

They hope to use the transmitter to create a sonar for the hidden Klingon ships . They discover that Pahvo is inhabited with indigenous life that introduce Saru to their higher understanding of peace , and he attempts to force Burnham and Tyler to remain with him on the planet forever . Burnham is able to fight off Saru and broadcast the new signal . However , the Pahvo lifeforms adjust the signal to contact the Klingons as well , hoping to end the war .

when was the term social justice first used	<P> The first modern usage of the specific term `` social justice '' is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s , including the Jesuit Luigi Taparelli in Civiltà Cattolica , based on the work of St. Thomas Aquinas . He argued that rival capitalist and socialist theories , based on subjective Cartesian thinking , undermined the unity of society present in Thomistic metaphysics as neither were sufficiently concerned with moral philosophy . Writing in 1861 , the influential British philosopher and economist , John Stuart Mill stated in Utilitarianism his view that `` Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it , that is , who have deserved equally well absolutely . This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice ; towards which all institutions , and the efforts of all virtuous citizens , should be made in the utmost degree to converge .

when did it become law to stand for the national anthem	<P> When the National Anthem was first recognized by law in 1932 , there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing . On June 22 , 1942 , the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing , while others should simply stand at attention , men removing their hats . ( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart . After 9 / 11 , the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the Anthem became nearly universal . </P>	['June 22 , 1942']	June 22 , 1942

who is the father of genetics and what did he study	<P> Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants : plant height , pod shape and color , seed shape and color , and flower position and color . Taking seed color as an example , Mendel showed that when a true - breeding yellow pea and a true - breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds . However , in the next generation , the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow . To explain this phenomenon , Mendel coined the terms `` recessive '' and `` dominant '' in reference to certain traits . ( In the preceding example , the green trait , which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation , is recessive and the yellow is dominant . ) He published his work in 1866 , demonstrating the actions of invisible `` factors '' -- now called genes -- in predictably determining the traits of an organism . </P>	['Mendel', 'pea plants']	Mendel

where does hydrogen peroxide come from in the body	<P> Hydrogen peroxide is formed in human and animals as a short - lived product in biochemical processes and is toxic to cells . The toxicity is due to oxidation of proteins , membrane lipids and DNA by the peroxide ions . The class of biological enzymes called SOD ( superoxide dismutase ) is developed in nearly all living cells as an important antioxidant agent . They promote the disproportionation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide , which is then rapidly decomposed by the enzyme catalase to oxygen and water . </P>	['nearly all living cells']	nearly all living cells

who developed the central processing unit (cpu)	<P> The idea of a stored - program computer was already present in the design of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly 's ENIAC , but was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner . On June 30 , 1945 , before ENIAC was made , mathematician John von Neumann distributed the paper entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . It was the outline of a stored - program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949 . EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of instructions ( or operations ) of various types . Significantly , the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high - speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer . This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC , which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task . With von Neumann 's design , the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory . EDVAC , however , was not the first stored - program computer ; the Manchester Small - Scale Experimental Machine , a small prototype stored - program computer , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 and the Manchester Mark 1 ran its first program during the night of 16 -- 17 June 1949 . </P>	['John von Neumann']	John von Neumann
what is a another name for the water cycle	<P> The water cycle , also known as the hydrological cycle or the hydrologic cycle , describes the continuous movement of water on , above and below the surface of the Earth . The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice , fresh water , saline water and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables . The water moves from one reservoir to another , such as from river to ocean , or from the ocean to the atmosphere , by the physical processes of evaporation , condensation , precipitation , infiltration , surface runoff , and subsurface flow . In doing so , the water goes through different forms : liquid , solid ( ice ) and vapor . </P>	['the hydrological cycle or the hydrologic cycle']	the hydrological cycle or the hydrologic cycle
what is the biggest determinant of climate in venezuela	<P> The Climate of Venezuela is characterized for being tropical and isothermal as a result of its geographical location near the Equator , but because of the topography and the dominant wind direction , several climatic types occur which can be the same as found in temperate latitudes , and even polar regions . Latitude exerts little influence on the Venezuelan climate , but the altitude changes it dramatically , particularly the temperature , reaching values very different according to the presence of different thermal floors . </P>	['altitude']	altitude
who invented the printing press and in what year	<P> The printing press was invented in the Holy Roman Empire by the German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 , based on existing screw presses . Gutenberg , a goldsmith by profession , developed a printing system , by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes , as well as making inventions of his own . His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities . Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe . In East Asia , where it was invented , the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and , without the hand mould , the production of sorts ( individual letters of type ) was slow . In Europe , the two inventions , the hand mould and the printing press , together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents , particularly in short print runs . </P>	['Johannes Gutenberg', '1440']	Johannes Gutenberg

what is the meaning of the harp in ireland	<P> However , reference to the harp as the arms of the king of Ireland can be found in one of the oldest medieval rolls of arms . The Wijnbergen Roll , a French roll of arms dating from c. 1280 and preserved in The Hague , Netherlands , attributed `` D'azure a la harpe d'or '' ( English : Blue with a harp of gold ) to the King of Ireland ( `` le Roi d'Irlande '' ) . The harp , traditionally associated with King David , was a rare charge on medieval rolls and only two arms with a harp are listed in a collection of 19 early rolls . Triangular devices appeared on medieval Irish coinage by kings John and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . These devices may have been crude harps or it may be that the harp developed from the use of triangles to distinguish Irish coins . The idea of a harp being the arms of Ireland may have originated as a reference to a fictional character , le roi d'irelande , in the courtly legend cycle of Tristan . Alternatively , it may have derived from a celebrated 13th century bardic poem , Tabhroidh Chugam Cruit mo Riogh , dedicated to the Donnchadh Cairbreach O'Briain ( d . 1242 ) , a Gaelic King of Thomond . </P>	['the arms of Ireland']	the arms of Ireland
what is the origin of the word celsius	<P> The Celsius scale , previously known as the centigrade scale , is a temperature scale used by the International System of Units ( SI ) . As an SI derived unit , it is used by all countries in the world , except the United States , Myanmar , and Liberia . It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius ( 1701 -- 1744 ) , who developed a similar temperature scale . The degree Celsius ( symbol : ° C ) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval , a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty . Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948 , the unit was called centigrade , from the Latin centum , which means 100 , and gradus , which means steps . </P>	['the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius']	the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius

when was kudzu introduced to the united states	<P> The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City . </P>	['1876']	1876

The culmination of the Yorktown campaign , the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater , as the surrender by Cornwallis , and the capture of both him and his army , prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict .

who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals	<P> Santiago Ramón y Cajal proposed that neurons are not continuous throughout the body , yet still communicate with each other , an idea known as the neuron doctrine . The word `` synapse '' -- from the Greek synapsis ( συνάψις ) , meaning `` conjunction '' , in turn from συνάπτεὶν ( συν ( `` together '' ) and ἅπτειν ( `` to fasten '' ) ) -- was introduced in 1897 by the English neurophysiologist Charles Sherrington in Michael Foster 's Textbook of Physiology . Sherrington struggled to find a good term that emphasized a union between two separate elements , and the actual term `` synapse '' was suggested by the English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall , a friend of Michael Foster . Some authors generalize the concept of the synapse to include the communication from a neuron to any other cell type , such as to a motor cell , although such non-neuronal contacts may be referred to as junctions ( a historically older term ) . </P>	['Charles Sherrington']	Charles Sherrington

today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology	<P> Gestalt psychology or gestaltism ( German : Gestalt ( ɡəˈʃtalt ) `` shape , form '' ) is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology . Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together . '' </P>	['experimental psychology']	experimental psychology
how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island	<P> Long John Silver is a cunning and opportunistic pirate who was quartermaster under the notorious Captain Flint . Long John Silver had a pet parrot called Captain Flint , often seen sitting on his shoulder where she would nibble on seeds . Silver claims to have served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under `` the immortal Hawke '' . `` His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder , he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird . He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling . '' ( Treasure Island ( 1883 ) by Robert Louis Stevenson page 82 ) . He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared . Like many of Stevenson 's characters , there is more than a modicum of duality in the character ; ostensibly Silver is a hardworking and likeable seaman , and it is only as the plot unfolds that his villainous nature is gradually revealed . His relationship with Jim Hawkins , the novel 's protagonist and narrator , is interesting , as he serves as a mentor and eventually father - figure to Jim , creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny , and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on . Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him . </P>	['in the Royal Navy']	in the Royal Navy

why does kerosene oil rise up in the wick of lantern	<P> A flat - wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp , which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action . If this type of lamp is broken , it can easily start a fire . A flat - wick lamp has a fuel tank ( fount ) , with the lamp burner attached . Attached to the fuel tank , four prongs hold the glass chimney , which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced draft . The glass chimney needs a `` throat '' , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce . </P>	['capillary action']	capillary action
mention the chemical change that proinsulin undergo to be able to act as mature insulin	<P> The post translational modification of proinsulin to mature insulin only occurs in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans . When proinsulin is transported through the Golgi apparatus the C - peptide is cleaved . This cleavage occurs with the aid of two endoproteases . Type I endoproteases , PC1 and PC3 , disrupt the C peptide - B chain connection . PC2 , a type II endoprotease , cleaves the C peptide - A chain bond . The resulting molecule , now mature insulin , is stored as a hexamer in secretory vesicles and is stabilized with Z n 2 + ( \ displaystyle Zn ^ ( 2 + ) ) molecules until it is secreted . </P>	['post translational modification']	post translational modification

where did the term liberal arts come from	<P> Rooted in the basic curriculum -- the enkuklios paideia or `` education in a circle '' -- of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece , the `` liberal arts '' or `` liberal pursuits '' ( Latin liberalia studia ) were already so called in formal education during the Roman Empire .

american horror story freak show girl kidnapped by clown	<Li> Twisty the Clown ( portrayed by John Carroll Lynch ) originally was a slow - witted but gentle clown at a freak show in 1943 . Jealous of his popularity , the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away . With nowhere else to go , he returned home to Jupiter , Florida , only to find that his mother had died . After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store , Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth . However , the attempt failed -- he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw -- and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face . Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa 's freak show , but was turned away . Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree , abducting children to be his audience , while murdering their `` mean '' parents . He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents , after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience 's babysitter . Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy , who becomes his accomplice . Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween , before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety . Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake , who was attracted by the noise of the clown 's performance . Twisty tells Mordrake his story , and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him . When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962 , Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments . According to director Ryan Murphy , Lynch was so terrifying as this character that `` half the time , almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him . '' In Cult , a comic book detailing a fictionalized version of Twisty is owned by Oz Mayfair - Richards . </Li>	['Bonnie Lipton']	Bonnie Lipton

who votes in the baseball hall of fame	<P> Players are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the Baseball Writers ' Association of America ( or BBWAA ) , or the Veterans Committee , which now consists of four subcommittees , each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball . Five years after retirement , any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee ( which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification ) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years ' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election ( the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election ) . From a final ballot typically including 25 -- 40 candidates , each writer may vote for up to 10 players ; until the late 1950s , voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates . Any player named on 75 % or more of all ballots cast is elected . A player who is named on fewer than 5 % of ballots is dropped from future elections . In some instances , the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots , but in the mid-1990s , dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration , even by the Veterans Committee . A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players ; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots , they may be considered by the Veterans Committee . Players receiving 5 % or more of the votes but fewer than 75 % are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility ( lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election ) . </P>	"[""Baseball Writers ' Association of America"", 'Veterans Committee']"	Baseball Writers ' Association of America

what are the ranks in the us navy	<P> A United States Navy enlisted rate indicates where an enlisted sailor stands within the chain of command , and also defines one 's pay grade . An enlisted sailor 's rate is similar conceptually to a naval officer 's rank . Only naval officers carry the term `` rank '' .

where does the term the west come from	<P> The geopolitical divisions in Europe that created a concept of East and West originated in the Roman Empire . The Eastern Mediterranean was home to the highly urbanized cultures that had Greek as their common language ( owing to the older empire of Alexander the Great and of the Hellenistic successors ) , whereas the West was much more rural in its character and more readily adopted Latin as its common language . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , Western and Central Europe were substantially cut off from the East where Byzantine Greek culture and Eastern Christianity became founding influences in the Arab / Muslim world and among the Eastern and Southern Slavic peoples . Roman Catholic Western and Central Europe , as such , maintained a distinct identity particularly as it began to redevelop during the Renaissance . Even following the Protestant Reformation , Protestant Europe continued to see itself as more tied to Roman Catholic Europe than other parts of the perceived civilized world . </P>	['the Roman Empire']	the Roman Empire
who is the first president to be impeached	<P> This was the first impeachment of a President since creation of the office in 1789 .

who created separation of powers and checks and balances	<P> Checks and balances is the principle that each of the Branches has the power to limit or check the other two and this creates a balance between the three separate powers of the state , this principle induces that the ambitions of one branch prevent that one of the other branches become supreme , and thus be eternally confronting each other and in that process leaving the people free from government abuses . Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place . This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches . They guarantee that the powers of the State have the same weight ( co-equal ) , that is , to be balanced , so that they can limit each other , avoiding the abuse of state power . the origin of checks and balances , like separation of powers itself , is specifically credited to Montesquieu in the Enlightenment ( in The Spirit of the Laws , 1748 ) , under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States . </P>	['Montesquieu in the Enlightenment']	Montesquieu in the Enlightenment

when does body temperature tend to be lowest	<P> In humans , a diurnal variation has been observed dependent on the periods of rest and activity , lowest at 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. and peaking at 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monkeys also have a well - marked and regular diurnal variation of body temperature that follows periods of rest and activity , and is not dependent on the incidence of day and night ; nocturnal monkeys reach their highest body temperature at night and lowest during the day . Sutherland Simpson and J.J. Galbraith observed that all nocturnal animals and birds -- whose periods of rest and activity are naturally reversed through habit and not from outside interference -- experience their highest temperature during the natural period of activity ( night ) and lowest during the period of rest ( day ) . Those diurnal temperatures can be reversed by reversing their daily routine . </P>	['11 p.m. to 3 a.m.']	11 p.m. to 3 a.m.

if a piece of music is perceived to have changed key then we say the piece has	<P> In traditional Western notation , the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale . As the music progresses , the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale . Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes , often to accommodate the range of a vocalist . Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range , but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale . For example , transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone . Since the interval relationships remain unchanged , transposition may be unnoticed by a listener , however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music . This often affects the music 's overall sound , as well as having technical implications for the performers . </P>	['transposed']	transposed

Icarus ' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris , asking that he fly neither too low nor too high , so the sea 's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun 's heat melt them .

where does trick or treat for unicef money go	<P> In 1953 , the United States Committee for UNICEF , now called the U.S. Fund for UNICEF , started actively promoting the program . By the 1960s , the concept had expanded throughout the United States , with small orange collection boxes distributed to millions of trick - or - treaters . When UNICEF won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 , U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson said in his congratulatory letter : `` Your UNICEF Trick or Treat Day has helped turn a holiday too often marred by youthful vandalism into a program of basic training in world citizenship . '' In 1967 , Johnson declared Halloween , October 31 , to be ' UNICEF Day ' in the United States ; by 1969 , 3.5 million American children were trick - or - treating for donations . Children ( and adults ) in the U.S. have collected more than US $ 175 million for Trick - or - Treat for UNICEF . Donations to Trick - or - Treat for UNICEF support UNICEF 's global programing , but in 2005 , half of the proceeds were targeted to a domestic cause , aiding victims of Hurricane Katrina . In 2008 , the U.S. Fund for UNICEF introduced mobile phone text message donations as well as a MySpace and Facebook page . In 2014 , the U.S. Fund for UNICEF partnered with Crowdrise to expand the campaign 's online presence , allowing participants to create personal fundraising web pages in addition to traditional door - to - door trick - or - treating . </P>	"[""UNICEF 's global programing""]"	UNICEF 's global programing

During this phase , the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis . Interphase is the ' daily living ' or metabolic phase of the cell , in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them , grows , reads its DNA , and conducts other `` normal '' cell functions . The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase . This phase was formerly called the resting phase . However , interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting ; rather , the cell is living , and preparing for later cell division , so the name was changed . A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis . However , since mitosis is the division of the nucleus , prophase is actually the first stage . </P>	['Interphase']	Interphase

who hung the lanterns in the old north church	<P> In April 1775 , Paul Revere told three Boston patriots to hang two lanterns in the steeple . These men were the church sexton Robert Newman and Captain John Pulling -- the two of whom historian David Hackett Fischer suggests each carried one lantern up to the steeple -- as well as Thomas Bernard , who stood watch for British troops outside the church . The lanterns were displayed to send a warning to Charlestown patriots across the Charles River about the movements of the British Army .

Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s , allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries . Babe Ruth , widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever , earned an estimated $910,696 ( $14,341,967 inflation - adjusted from 1931 dollars ) over his entire playing career . When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ( $1,146,932 inflation - adjusted ) , while the president , Herbert Hoover , had a $75,000 salary , Ruth famously remarked , `` What the hell has Hoover got to do with it ? Besides , I had a better year than he did . '' </P>	['Alex Rodriguez']	Alex Rodriguez

when did the legal drinking age changed to 21	<P> From 1976 to 1983 , several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 ( or , less commonly , 20 or 21 ) , in part to combat drunk driving fatalities . In 1984 , Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10 % of their federal highway funds . By mid-1988 , all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 ( but not Puerto Rico , Guam , or the Virgin Islands , see Additional Notes below ) . South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries . The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment . Although debates have not been highly publicized , a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age , while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010 . </P>	['By mid-1988']	By mid-1988

where does the spinal cord become cauda equina	<P> The cauda equina ( Latin for `` horse 's tail '' ) is a bundle of spinal nerves and spinal nerve rootlets , consisting of the second through fifth lumbar nerve pairs , the first through fifth sacral nerve pairs , and the coccygeal nerve , all of which arise from the lumbar enlargement and the conus medullaris of the spinal cord . The cauda equina occupies the lumbar cistern , a subarachnoid space inferior to the conus medullaris . The nerves that compose the cauda equina innervate the pelvic organs and lower limbs to include motor innervation of the hips , knees , ankles , feet , internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter . In addition , the cauda equina extends to sensory innervation of the perineum and , partially , parasympathetic innervation of the bladder . </P>	['the conus medullaris']	the conus medullaris

The procedure requires anastomosis of a single epididymal tubule ( luminal diameter . 15 -. 25 mm ) to the lumen of the vas deferens ( diameter . 3 -. 4 mm ) , and is reserved for patients with congenital or acquired epididymal obstruction , or patients who have failed previous attempts at surgical reconstruction of the vas deferens . This surgery attaches the vas deferens directly to the epididymis , the coiled tube on the back of each testicle where sperm matures . A vasectomy can cause blockages or a break in the vas deferens or the epididymis . This surgery is used when a vasovasostomy wo n't work because sperm flow is blocked . The vas deferens is connected to the epididymis above the point of blockage . </P>	['Vasoepididymostomy']	Vasoepididymostomy
who is given credit for inventing the aqua lung	<P> Aqua - Lung was the original English name of the first open - circuit , self - contained underwater breathing apparatus ( or `` SCUBA '' ) to reach worldwide popularity and commercial success . This class of equipment is now commonly referred to as a diving regulator or demand valve . The Aqua - Lung was invented in Paris during the winter of 1942 -- 1943 by two Frenchmen : the engineer Émile Gagnan and Naval Lieutenant ( `` lieutenant de vaisseau '' ) Jacques Cousteau . It allowed Cousteau and Gagnan to film and explore more easily underwater . </P>	['Émile Gagnan', 'Jacques Cousteau']	Émile Gagnan

where did the british army launch a successful invasion in 1776	<P> After withdrawing from Boston , Howe immediately began preparations to seize New York which was considered the ' hinge ' of the colonies . In late August , 22,000 men ( including 9,000 Hessians ) were rapidly landed on Long Island using flat bottomed boats , this would be the largest amphibious operation undertaken by the British army until the Normandy landings almost 200 years later . In the ensuing Battle of Long Island on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to the Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe not wishing to risk the lives of his men in a bloody frontal assault then began to lay siege works . The navy had failed to properly blockade the East river which left an escape route open for Washington 's army , which he fully exploited , managing a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear to Manhattan Island . British forces then fought a series of actions to consolidate control of Manhattan Island , culminating in the Battle of Fort Washington which resulted in the capture of close to 3,000 Continental troops . Following the conquest of Manhattan , Howe ordered Charles Cornwallis to `` clear the rebel troops from New Jersey without a major engagement , and to do it quickly before the weather changed . '' Cornwallis ' force drove Washington 's army entirely from New Jersey and across the Delaware River . However , in the pre-dawn hours of December 26 , Washington crossed back into New Jersey and captured a garrison of Hessians at Trenton . Several days later , Washington outmaneuvered Cornwallis at Assunpink Creek and overwhelmed a British outpost at Princeton on January 3 , 1777 . Cornwallis rallied and again drove Washington away , however the defeats showed the British army had become too overstretched and Howe abandoned most of his outposts in New Jersey . </P>	['New York']	New York

who made possible the first reproduction of the human voice on the phonograph	<P> The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison . While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems . </P>	['Thomas Edison']	Thomas Edison

Nicknamed `` The Imp '' or `` Halfman '' , Tyrion Lannister of House Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister . He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall .

where did the idea of a unicorn come from	<P> Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology , but rather in the accounts of natural history , for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns , which they believed lived in India , a distant and fabulous realm for them . The earliest description is from Ctesias , who in his book Indika ( `` On India '' ) described them as wild asses , fleet of foot , having a horn a cubit and a half ( 700 mm , 28 inches ) in length , and colored white , red and black . Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one - horned animals , the oryx ( a kind of antelope ) and the so - called `` Indian ass '' . Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one - horned horses with stag - like heads . Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox ( perhaps a rhinoceros ) as one - horned beasts , as well as `` a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag , the feet of the elephant , and the tail of the boar , while the rest of the body is like that of the horse ; it makes a deep lowing noise , and has a single black horn , which projects from the middle of its forehead , two cubits ( 900 mm , 35 inches ) in length . '' In On the Nature of Animals ( Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος , De natura animalium ) , Aelian , quoting Ctesias , adds that India produces also a one - horned horse ( iii. 41 ; iv. 52 ) , and says ( xvi. 20 ) that the monoceros ( Greek : μονόκερως ) was sometimes called cartazonos ( Greek : καρτάζωνος ) , which may be a form of the Arabic karkadann , meaning `` rhinoceros '' . </P>	['Greek writers of natural history']	Greek writers of natural history
which battle ended britain's support for the south	<P> Throughout the early years of the war , British foreign secretary Lord Russell , Napoleon III , and , to a lesser extent , British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston , explored the risks and advantages of recognition of the Confederacy or at least offering a mediation . Recognition meant certain war with the US , loss of American grain , loss of exports , loss of investments in American securities , potential invasion of Canada and other North American colonies , higher taxes , and a threat to the British merchant marine with little to gain in return . Many party leaders and the general public wanted no war with such high costs and meager benefits . Recognition was considered following the Second Battle of Manassas , when the British government was preparing to mediate in the conflict , but the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam and Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation , combined with internal opposition , caused the government to back away . </P>	['Battle of Antietam']	Battle of Antietam

what is the number of total presidential electoral votes	<P> Each state chooses electors , equal in number to that state 's combined total of senators and representatives . There are a total of 538 electors , corresponding to the 435 representatives and 100 senators , plus the three electors for the District of Columbia as provided by the Twenty - third Amendment . The Constitution bars any federal official , elected or appointed , from being an elector . The Office of the Federal Register is charged with administering the Electoral College . Since the mid-19th century when all electors have been popularly chosen , the Electoral College has elected the candidate who received the most popular votes nationwide , except in four elections : 1876 , 1888 , 2000 , and 2016 . In 1824 , there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed , rather than popularly elected , so the true national popular vote is uncertain ; the electors failed to select a winning candidate , so the matter was decided by the House of Representatives . </P>	['538']	538

They affect which tissues grow upward and which grow downward , leaf formation and stem growth , fruit development and ripening , plant longevity , and even plant death . Hormones are vital to plant growth , and , lacking them , plants would be mostly a mass of undifferentiated cells . So they are also known as growth factors or growth hormones .

china in chinese is called zhongguo which means	<P> Zhōngguó is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times .

what group of animals do octopus belong to	<P> The octopus ( / ˈɒktəpəs / or ~ / pʊs / ) is a soft - bodied , eight - armed mollusc of the order Octopoda . Around 300 species are recognised and the order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids , cuttlefish and nautiloids . Like other cephalopods , the octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak , with its mouth at the centre point of the arms ( which are sometimes mistakenly called `` tentacles '' ) . The soft body can rapidly alter its shape , enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps . They trail their eight arms behind them as they swim . The siphon is used both for respiration and for locomotion , by expelling a jet of water . Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight , and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates . </P>	['class Cephalopoda']	class Cephalopoda

what was the first light beer in the us	<P> Miller Lite was essentially the first mainstream light beer . After its first inception as `` Gablinger 's Diet Beer , '' developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades , PhD , a biochemist working for New York 's Rheingold Brewery , the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago 's Peter Hand Brewing . That year , Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors , renamed Meister Brau Brewing , and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite , a companion to their flagship Meister Brau . Under the new management , Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems , and in 1972 , sold several of its existing labels to Miller . The recipe was relaunched simply as `` Lite '' on packaging and in advertising ( with `` Lite Beer from Miller '' being its `` official '' name until the late ' 90s ) in the test markets of Springfield , Illinois , Knoxville , Tennessee , and San Diego , California , in 1973 , and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other , so - called , macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer - drinking male demographic . Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975 . Miller 's heavy - advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed , and Miller 's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace . Other brewers responded , in particular Anheuser - Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982 , which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994 . Anheuser - Busch played on the branding style of `` Lite '' by highlighting the fact that their beer was called `` Bud Light , '' as `` everything else is just a light . '' In 1992 , light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America , and in 1998 , Miller relabeled its `` Lite '' brand as `` Miller Lite . '' </P>	['Miller Lite']	Miller Lite

who had a baby at 100 in the bible	<P> In Genesis 17 when Abram was ninety - nine years old , God declared his new name : `` Abraham '' -- `` a father of many nations '' , and gave him the covenant of circumcision . God gave Sarai the new name `` Sarah '' , and blessed her . Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son . Not long afterwards , Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men . One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year , Sarah would have a son . While at the tent entrance , Sarah overheard what was said , and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages . The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child , for her age was as nothing to God . Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham , at the very time which had been spoken . The patriarch , then a hundred years old , named the child `` Isaac '' ( Hebrew yitschaq , `` laughter '' ) and circumcised him when he was eight days old . For Sarah , the thought of giving birth and nursing a child , at such an old age , also brought her much laughter , as she declared , `` God had made me to laugh , ( so that ) all that hear will laugh with me . '' Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned . It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company . Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked . </P>	['Abraham']	Abraham

when was the problem of cfc's discovered	<P> Since the late 1970s , the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer . After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond . </P>	['1974']	1974

what is the common name for gravitational force	<P> Gravity , or gravitation , is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward ( or gravitate toward ) one another , including objects ranging from atoms and photons , to planets and stars . Since energy and mass are equivalent , all forms of energy ( including light ) cause gravitation and are under the influence of it . On Earth , gravity gives weight to physical objects , and the Moon 's gravity causes the ocean tides . The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing , forming stars -- and for the stars to group together into galaxies -- so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe . Gravity has an infinite range , although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects . </P>	['Gravity']	Gravity

which of the following helmiths feeds on blood	<P> Helminths may cause iron - deficiency anemia . This is most severe in heavy hookworm infections , as Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale feed directly on the blood of their hosts . Although the daily consumption of an individual worm ( 0.02 -- 0.07 ml and 0.14 -- 0.26 ml respectively ) is small , the collective consumption under heavy infection can be clinically significantly . Intestinal whipworm may also cause anemia . Anemia has also been associated with reduced stamina for physical labor , a decline in the ability to learn new information , and apathy , irritability , and fatigue . A study of the effect of deworming and iron supplementation in 47 students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that the intervention improved cognitive function . Another study found that in 159 Jamaican schoolchildren , deworming led to better auditory short - term memory and scanning and retrieval of long - term memory over a period of nine - weeks . </P>	['Necator americanus', 'Ancylostoma duodenale']	Necator americanus

where does blonde hair green eyes come from	<P> A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the evolution of light hair is related to the evolution of light skin , and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe 's seasonal less solar radiation . Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation , thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way , high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation , which reduces the prevalence of rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency . The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the Inuit is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in , because in the polar climate there is more ice or snow on the ground , and this reflects the solar radiation onto the skin , making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond , brown or red hair , light skin and blue , grey or green eyes . </P>	['a low concentration in pigmentation']	a low concentration in pigmentation

who proposed the virginia plan at the constitutional convention	<P> The most contentious disputes revolved around composition and election of the upper legislative house in the future bicameral Congress , to be known as the Senate , how `` proportional representation '' was to be defined ( whether to include slaves or other property ) , whether to divide the executive power between three persons or invest the power into a single chief executive to be called the President , how to elect the President , how long his term was to be and whether he could run for reelection , what offenses should be impeachable , the nature of a fugitive slave clause , whether to allow the abolition of the slave trade , and whether judges should be chosen by the legislature or executive . Most of the time during the Convention was spent on deciding these issues , while the powers of legislature , executive , and judiciary were not heavily disputed . Once the Convention began , the delegates first agreed on the principles of the Convention , then they agreed on Madison 's proposed Virginia Plan and began to modify it . A Committee of Detail , assembled during the July 4th recess , eventually produced a rough draft of the constitution . Most of the rough draft remained in place , and can be found in the final version of the constitution . After the final issues were resolved , the Committee on Style produced the final version , and it was voted on by the delegates , inscribed on parchment with engraving for printing and sent to the states and their legislatures . </P>	['Madison']	Madison

what does sip stand for in the ngn / ims context	<P> To ease the integration with the Internet , IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible , e.g. , SIP ( Session Initiation Protocol ) . According to the 3GPP , IMS is not intended to standardize applications , but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals , i.e. , to create a form of fixed - mobile convergence ( FMC ) . This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer . From a logical architecture perspective , services need not have their own control functions , as the control layer is a common horizontal layer . However , in implementation this does not necessarily map into greater reduced cost and complexity . </P>	['Session Initiation Protocol']	Session Initiation Protocol

Explanations for the demise of the Yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against Han Chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion , overtaxation of areas hard - hit by inflation , and massive flooding of the Yellow River as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects . Consequently , agriculture and the economy were in shambles , and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the Yellow River .

the era of the great mughals began with the accession of	<P> The beginning of the empire is conventionally dated to the victory by its founder Babur over Ibrahim Lodi , the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate , in the First Battle of Panipat ( 1526 ) . The Mughal emperors had roots in the Turco - Mongol Timurid dynasty of Central Asia , claiming direct descent from both Genghis Khan ( founder of the Mongol Empire , through his son Chagatai Khan ) and Timur ( Turco - Mongol conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire ) . During the reign of Humayun , the successor of Babur , the empire was briefly interrupted by the Sur Empire . The `` classic period '' of the Mughal Empire started in 1556 with the ascension of Akbar the Great to the throne . Under the rule of Akbar and his son Jahangir , the region enjoyed economic progress as well as religious harmony , and the monarchs were interested in local religious and cultural traditions . Akbar was a successful warrior who also forged alliances with several Hindu Rajput kingdoms . Some Rajput kingdoms continued to pose a significant threat to the Mughal dominance of northwestern India , but most of them were subdued by Akbar . All Mughal emperors were Muslims ; Akbar , however , propounded a syncretic religion in the latter part of his life called Dīn - i Ilāhī , as recorded in historical books like Ain - i - Akbari and Dabistān - i Mazāhib . </P>	['Babur']	Babur

what parts make up the peripheral nervous system	<P> The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic . </P>	['somatic nervous system', 'autonomic nervous system']	somatic nervous system

where do red ear slider turtles lay eggs	<P> After mating , the female spends extra time basking to keep her eggs warm . She may also have a change of diet , eating only certain foods , or not eating as much as she normally would . A female can lay between two and 30 eggs depending on body size and other factors . One female can lay up to five clutches in the same year , and clutches are usually spaced 12 to 36 days apart . The time between mating and egg - laying can be days or weeks . The actual egg fertilization takes place during the egg - laying . This process also permits the laying of fertile eggs the following season , as the sperm can remain viable and available in the female 's body in the absence of mating . During the last weeks of gestation , the female spends less time in the water and smells and scratches at the ground , indicating she is searching for a suitable place to lay her eggs . The female excavates a hole , using her hind legs , and lays her eggs in it . </P>	['a hole']	a hole

who is the girl in the stone sour video say you'll haunt me	<P> The video begins with a car ( 1972 Plymouth Barracuda ) pulling into a creepy alleyway with Corey Taylor being pulled out of the trunk by his bandmates . He is then lead upstairs to be strapped into a chair and interrogated by a woman ( Joanna Moskawa ) who seems to have an aggression towards him . As this is happening , ghostly images of the band perform in front of each member , the video also features these images solo inside an abandoned warehouse including Taylor . Taylor is then blindfolded and then a weird screen is brought out . Corey then walks into the room from the shadows , with a shaved head , wearing a suit and sunglasses . He takes the sunglasses off and then the blindfold is removed , revealing the woman from before . At the end of the solo and the final `` everything to '' shaved Corey presses the button and the other Corey is then seen singing on the screen . The lady panics from this sight and the rest of the band have smiles on their faces . At the end of the video the band leaves the lady tied . Right before it fades to black , the screen says `` What did you see ? '' This was part of a contest that the band held to see the concept of the video , which had a code which read `` I am you '' which explains the fact Corey was replaced with the woman . </P>	['Joanna Moskawa']	Joanna Moskawa

how many paintings of sunflowers did van gogh paint	<P> Sunflowers ( original title , in French : Tournesols ) is the name of two series of still life paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh . The first series , executed in Paris in 1887 , depicts the flowers lying on the ground , while the second set , executed a year later in Arles , shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase . In the artist 's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin , who acquired two of the Paris versions . About eight months later van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers , now part of the painted Décoration for the Yellow House that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles , where Gauguin was supposed to stay . After Gauguin 's departure , van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych , and finally he included them in his Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit . </P>	['two']	two

who was assassinated during a visit to sarajevo in bosnia	<P> The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir presumptive to the Austro - Hungarian throne , and his wife Sophie , Duchess of Hohenberg , occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip . Princip was one of a group of six assassins ( five Serbs and one Bosniak ) coordinated by Danilo Ilić , a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society . The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria - Hungary 's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia . The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia . The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria - Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , which was partially rejected .

The use of meditation and specifically , mindfulness , is a growing practice in the field of arousal recognition . The Mindfulness - Acceptance - Commitment ( MAC ) Theory is the most common form of mindfulness in sport and was formed in 2001 . The aim of MAC is to maximize human potential for a rich , full and meaningful life . It includes specific protocol that involve meditation and acceptance practices on a regular basis as well as before and during competition . These protocol have been tested various times using NCAA men 's and women 's basketball players . In a study done by Frank L. Gardner , an NCAA women 's basketball player increased her personal satisfaction in her performances from 2.4 out of 10 to 9.2 out of 10 after performing the specific MAC protocol for several weeks . Also , the effect of mental barriers on her game decreased from 8 out of 8 to 2.2 out of 8 during that same time period as a result of the MAC protocol . Another study of the MAC protocol performed by Frank Gardner and Zella Moore on an adolescent competitive diver showed that when the MAC protocol is tailored to a specific population , it has the potential to provide performance enhancement . In this case , the vocabulary and examples in the protocol were tailored to be more practical for a 12 - year - old . After performed the MAC protocol for several weeks , the diver showed between a 13 to 14 percent increase in his diving scores . This finding is important because previously the majority of tests performed using the MAC protocol had been on world class athletes . </P>	['Arousal regulation']	Arousal regulation

what are the active materials of a lead acid battery	<P> Lead -- acid batteries lose the ability to accept a charge when discharged for too long due to sulfation , the crystallization of lead sulfate . They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction . Lead and lead dioxide , the active materials on the battery 's plates , react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate . The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided , amorphous state , and easily reverts to lead , lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges . As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges , some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging . Thus , not all the lead is returned to the battery plates , and the amount of usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time . </P>	['Lead', 'lead dioxide', 'sulfuric acid']	Lead

where is the oldest civilization known to man	<P> Around 10,200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ( PPNA ) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ( 7600 to 6000 BC ) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards . One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies . It is because of this that the fertile crescent region , and Mesopotamia in particular , are often referred to as the cradle of civilization . The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain , although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium . It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began . Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities , particularly in Northern Mesopotamia , and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south . Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period , around 5300 BC , and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period .

who invented the printing press and what year	<P> Johannes Gutenberg , a goldsmith by profession , developed , circa 1439 , a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes , as well as making inventions of his own . Printing in East Asia had been prevalent since the Tang dynasty , and in Europe , woodblock printing based on existing screw presses was common by the 14th century . Gutenberg 's most important innovation was the development of hand - molded metal printing matrices , thus producing a movable type based printing press system . His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities . Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe .

how much of the world's diamonds does de beers own	<P> In 2000 , the De Beers business model changed because of factors such as the decision by producers in Canada and Australia to distribute diamonds outside the De Beers channel , as well as rising awareness of blood diamonds that forced De Beers to `` avoid the risk of bad publicity '' by limiting sales to its own mined products . De Beers ' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90 % in the 1980s to 33 % in 2013 , because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition , as well as more transparency and greater liquidity . In November 2011 , the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40 % stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc , thereby increasing Anglo American 's ownership of the company to 85 % ( the other 15 % is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana ) .

which is produced in plants of narora kakrapar tarapur	<P> Tarapur Atomic Power Station ( T.A.P.S. ) is located in Tarapur , Palghar , India. Tarapur is the largest nuclear power station in India . It was constructed initially with two boiling water reactor ( BWR ) units by Bechtel and GE under the 1963 123 Agreement between India , the United States , and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . Units 1 and 2 were brought online for commercial operation on 28 October 1969 with an initial power of 210 MW of electricity , later on this was reduced to 160 MW due to technical difficulties . These were the first of their kind in Asia . More recently , an additional two pressurised heavy water reactor ( PHWR ) units of 540 MW each were constructed by L&T and Gammon India , seven months ahead of schedule and well within the original cost estimates . Unit 3 was brought online for commercial operation on 18 August 2006 , and unit 4 on 12 September 2005 . </P>	['Atomic Power']	Atomic Power
when did fender start making amps in mexico	<P> The Red Knob amplifiers were produced from 1987 until 1993 . These were some of the first models produced by the newly formed Fender Musical Instrument Corporation . These amplifiers , named for their bright red control knobs , have a slightly similar appearance to the older Blackface cosmetics , having black control panels with white lettering and the late 1970s `` scripted tailless '' Fender logo . Many of these models were simply refitted with black knobs and early 1970s `` unscripted tailless '' Fender logos in 1996 when most Fender amplifier manufacturing moved to the Ensenada factory in Mexico . This series of amplifiers all used printed circuit board construction and can be difficult for amateur amp techs to service . The Red Knob amps , with their high - gain channels , had their own sound , not much like the older classic Blackface and Silverface designs . </P>	['1996']	1996
the boiling point of water is 100 degrees celsius express this in si units	<P> The Celsius scale was based on 0 ° C for the freezing point of water and 100 ° C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure following a change introduced in 1743 by Jean - Pierre Christin to reverse the Celsius thermometer scale ( from water boiling at 0 degrees and ice melting at 100 degrees ) . This scale is widely taught in schools today . By international agreement the unit `` degree Celsius '' and the Celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures : absolute zero , and the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ( VSMOW ) , a specially purified water . This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale , which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero , the lowest temperature possible , is defined as being exactly 0 K and − 273.15 ° C. The temperature of the triple point of water is defined as exactly 273.16 K ( 0.01 ° C ; 32.02 ° F ) . </P>	['100 ° C']	100 ° C

who played young monica in love and basketball	<P> The film spans roughly thirteen years of friendship between childhood sweethearts Monica Wright and Quincy McCall . The first quarter of the story begins in 1981 , when Monica ( played as a youth by Kyla Pratt ) and her family moved to Los Angeles in 1981 from Atlanta , Georgia , and quickly became acquainted with their new neighbors the McCalls , a wealthy family due to the success of Quincy 's father Zeke , the star shooting guard for the Los Angeles Clippers . Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly , sharing a love of the game : basketball . Quincy ( played as a youth by Glendon Chattman ) is shocked that a girl could ever love basketball as much as he did , and he is even more shocked when Monica plays so well . Although their first interaction results in Quincy angrily knocking her down during game point and accidentally scarring her face , they share their first kiss on the first day of school and end the `` first quarter '' of the story fighting in the grass . </P>	['Kyla Pratt']	Kyla Pratt

when was the movie the king and i made	<P> The King and I is a 1956 American musical film made by 20th Century Fox , directed by Walter Lang and produced by Charles Brackett and Darryl F. Zanuck . The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is based on the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musical The King and I , based in turn on the novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon . That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by Anna Leonowens , who became school teacher to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s . Leonowens ' stories were autobiographical , although various elements of them have been called into question . The film stars Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner . </P>	['1956']	1956
when do dwight and angela start dating again	<P> Dwight is the only person that Angela likes in the office . It is shown in `` E-mail Surveillance '' that Dwight and Angela have begun a romantic relationship . Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him , she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship , and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight 's passion for her . Their relationship is seemingly summarized in `` A.A.R.M. '' : when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses `` how loudly I love you '' , Angela meekly whispers `` It 's too loud . '' In `` Traveling Salesman '' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate , so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them . After Dwight is told he would be fired if he did n't tell Michael why he went to New York , he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela . Angela later tells Michael what happened , but still does n't reveal their relationship . In `` Fun Run '' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles , who is feeling sick , but Dwight kills it , which causes Angela to break up with him . After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4 , she stops dating Dwight , but at the end of `` Goodbye Toby '' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight . Dwight ends their affair in `` The Duel '' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy . In `` The Delivery '' Dwight , who wants to improve his sales by having a child , asks Angela to have his baby . The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together , but in `` Happy Hour '' , Dwight hooks up with Pam 's friend Isabel , and tells Angela he does n't want her to have his baby . In `` The Chump '' the two call in a lawyer , and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times . She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton . After she gives birth ( Jury Duty ) , Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he , not Robert , is the father . Angela and Dwight go through a paternity test and in `` New Guys '' it is revealed that Dwight is not Philip 's father . In `` A.A.R.M. '' Dwight proposes to Angela , and she accepts . She then tells Dwight that she lied before and Dwight is Philip 's father . Angela tells him that she wanted to make sure that Dwight wanted to marry her for no other reason than for love . </P>	['Goodbye Toby']	Goodbye Toby

who are considered to be the founding fathers	<P> Historian Richard B. Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers : John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , and George Washington . Adams , Jefferson , and Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence . Hamilton , Madison , and Jay were authors of The Federalist Papers , advocating ratification of the Constitution . The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York ( 1777 ) and Massachusetts ( 1780 ) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution Jay , Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) that would end the American Revolutionary War . Washington was Commander - in - Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention . Washington , Jay and Franklin are considered the Founding Fathers of U.S. Intelligence by the CIA . All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States , with Washington , Adams , Jefferson , and Madison serving as President . Jay was the nation 's first Chief Justice . Four of these seven -- Washington , Jay , Hamilton and Madison -- were not signers of the Declaration of Independence . </P>	['John Adams', 'Benjamin Franklin', 'Alexander Hamilton', 'John Jay', 'Thomas Jefferson', 'James Madison', 'George Washington']	John Adams
who sings in walk hard the dewey cox story	<P> Singer - songwriters Dan Bern and Mike Viola ( of the Candy Butchers ) wrote most of the film 's songs , including `` There 's a Change a Happenin ' '' , `` Mulatto '' , `` A Life Without You ( Is No Life at All ) '' , `` Beautiful Ride '' and `` Hole in My Pants '' . Charlie Wadhams wrote the song `` Let 's Duet '' . Marshall Crenshaw wrote the title song , and Van Dyke Parks penned the Brian Wilson-esque 1960s - styled psychedelic jam `` Black Sheep '' ( the recording session seems to be a specific parody of Wilson 's Smile album sessions , on which Van Dyke Parks worked ) . Antonio Ortiz wrote `` Take My Hand '' . A number of critics noted the unusually high quality of many of the individual songs on the soundtrack , how well they reflected the styles and times they were attempting to parody , and how well they stood on their own as quality compositions . The soundtrack was nominated for both a Grammy and Golden Globe Award and was nominated and won the Sierra Award for Best Song in a Motion Picture from the Las Vegas Film Critics Society . John C. Reilly sang on all the tracks and played guitar on most of them . </P>	['John C. Reilly']	John C. Reilly

when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth	<P> Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate . </P>	['1990']	1990

who supported states rights during the civil war	<P> Many southern whites had considered themselves more Southern than American and were prepared to fight for their state and their region to be independent of the larger nation . That regionalism became a Southern nationalism , or the `` Cause '' . For the duration of its existence , the Confederacy underwent trial by war . The `` Southern Cause '' transcended the ideology of states ' rights , tariff policy , or internal improvements . This `` Cause '' supported , or descended from , cultural and financial dependence on the South 's slavery - based economy . The convergence of race and slavery , politics , and economics raised almost all South - related policy questions to the status of moral questions over way of life , commingling love of things Southern and hatred of things Yankee ( the North ) . Not only did national political parties split , but national churches and interstate families as well divided along sectional lines as the war approached . According to historian John M. Coski , `` The statesmen who led the secession movement were unashamed to explicitly cite the defense of slavery as their prime motive ... Acknowledging the centrality of slavery to the Confederacy is essential for understanding the Confederate . '' </P>	['the Confederacy']	the Confederacy

what are the main sources of economic growth in the us currently	<P> The U.S. produces approximately 18 % of the world 's manufacturing output , a share that has declined as other nations developed competitive manufacturing industries . The job loss during this continual volume growth is the result of multiple factors including increased productivity , trade , and secular economic trends . In addition , growth in telecommunications , pharmaceuticals , aircraft , heavy machinery and other industries along with declines in low end , low skill industries such as clothing , toys , and other simple manufacturing have resulted in some U.S. jobs being more highly skilled and better paying . There has been much debate within the United States on whether the decline in manufacturing jobs are related to American unions , lower foreign wages , or both . </P>	['telecommunications', 'pharmaceuticals', 'aircraft', 'heavy machinery']	telecommunications

the part of the cytoskeleton made from the protein actin is called	<P> A large - scale example of an action performed by the cytoskeleton is muscle contraction . In the muscle , there are groups of highly specialized cells that work together to perform a function known as muscle contraction . A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is known as a microfilament . Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin . During contraction of a muscle , within each muscle cell , myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments . Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum . Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins , tropomyosin and troponin . Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin , while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition . This action contracts the muscle cell , and through the synchronous process in many muscle cells , the entire muscle . </P>	['microfilament']	microfilament

where is a simple gear train used in real life	<P> Automobile drivetrains generally have two or more major areas where gearing is used . Gearing is employed in the transmission , which contains a number of different sets of gears that can be changed to allow a wide range of vehicle speeds , and also in the differential , which contains the final drive to provide further speed reduction at the wheels . In addition , the differential contains further gearing that splits torque equally between the two wheels while permitting them to have different speeds when travelling in a curved path . The transmission and final drive might be separate and connected by a driveshaft , or they might be combined into one unit called a transaxle . The gear ratios in transmission and final drive are important because different gear ratios will change the characteristics of a vehicle 's performance . </P>	['Automobile drivetrains']	Automobile drivetrains

what is the process to become a santero	<P> To become a Santero or Santera ( Priest or Priestess of Santería ) , the initiator must go through an intensive week - long initiation process in which the teaching of the ritual skills and moral behavior occurs informally and nonverbally . To begin with , the initiator goes through what is called a cleansing ritual . The initiator 's Padrino ( godfather ) cleanses the head with special herbs and water . The Padrino rubs the herbs and water in a specific pattern of movements into the scalp of the head . However , if a person is entering Santería for the need of healing , they will undergo the rogación de la cabeza ( blessing of the head ) , in which coconut water and cotton are applied on the head to feed it . Once cleansed , there are four major initiation rituals that the initiator will have to undergo : obtaining the elekes ( beaded necklace ) , receiving Los Guerreros ( the Warriors ) , making Ochá ( Saint ) , and Asiento ( ascending the throne ) . </P>	['a cleansing ritual', 'obtaining the elekes ( beaded necklace )', 'receiving Los Guerreros ( the Warriors )', 'making Ochá ( Saint )', 'Asiento ( ascending the throne )']	a cleansing ritual

why was the plague that struck athens so devastating	<P> Sparta and its allies , with the exception of Corinth , were almost exclusively land based powers , able to summon large land armies that were very nearly unbeatable . Under the direction of Pericles , the Athenians pursued a policy of retreat within the city walls of Athens , relying on Athenian maritime supremacy for supply while the superior Athenian navy harassed Spartan troop movements . Unfortunately the strategy also resulted in adding many people from the countryside to an already well - populated city , introducing a severe crowding factor as well as resource shortages . Due to the close quarters and poor hygiene exhibited at that time Athens became a breeding ground for disease and many citizens died including Pericles , his wife , and his sons Paralus and Xanthippus . In the history of epidemics the ' Plague ' of Athens is remarkable for its one - sided affliction and bias on the ultimate outcome of a war . </P>	['close quarters and poor hygiene']	close quarters and poor hygiene
who was it that described the structure of dna	<P> DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869 . Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953 , whose model - building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling , who was a post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin . DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories , such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity . The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro - and nano - fabrication . Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA - based hybrid materials . </P>	['James Watson', 'Francis Crick']	James Watson

when does synapsis of homologous chromosomes occur in mitosis	<P> Synapsis ( also called syndesis ) is the pairing of two homologous chromosomes that occurs during meiosis . It allows matching - up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation , and possible chromosomal crossover between them . Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis . When homologous chromosomes synapse , their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope . These end - membrane complexes then migrate , assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton , until matching ends have been paired . Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together , and may be connected by a protein - RNA complex called the synaptonemal complex . Autosomes undergo synapsis during meiosis , and are held together by a protein complex along the whole length of the chromosomes called the synaptonemal complex . Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis ; however , the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present at one end of each sex chromosome . </P>	['prophase I of meiosis']	prophase I of meiosis

Originally , ' I ' and ' J ' were different shapes for the same letter , both equally representing / i / , / iː / , and / j / ; but , Romance languages developed new sounds ( from former / j / and / ɡ / ) that came to be represented as ' I ' and ' J ' ; therefore , English J , acquired from the French J , has a sound value quite different from / j / ( which represents the initial sound in the English word `` yet '' ) . </P>	['1524']	1524

roman god of the underworld also called orcus or pluto	<P> Plūtō ( ( ˈpluːtoː ) ; genitive Plūtōnis ) is the Latinized form of the Greek Plouton . Pluto 's Roman equivalent is Dis Pater , whose name is most often taken to mean `` Rich Father '' and is perhaps a direct translation of Plouton . Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman Orcus , like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place . The borrowed Greek name Pluto is sometimes used for the ruler of the dead in Latin literature , leading some mythology handbooks to assert misleadingly that Pluto was the Roman counterpart of Hades . Pluto ( Pluton in French and German , Plutone in Italian ) becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms . </P>	['Dis Pater']	Dis Pater

what happened to western rome after it fell	<P> The Fall of the Western Roman Empire ( also called Fall of the Roman Empire or Fall of Rome ) was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which it failed to enforce its rule , and its vast territory was divided into several successor polities . The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control ; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army , the health and numbers of the Roman population , the strength of the economy , the competence of the Emperor , the religious changes of the period , and the efficiency of the civil administration . Increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse . The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure . </P>	['divided into several successor polities']	divided into several successor polities

who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition	<P> In music , serialism is a method of composition using series of pitches , rhythms , dynamics , timbres or other musical elements .

where did the tradition of the pinata come from	<P> A piñata ( / pɪnˈjɑːtə / , US pronunciation / pɪnˈjɑːdɑː / , Spanish pronunciation : ( piˈɲata ) ( listen ) ) is a container often made of papier - mâché , pottery , or cloth ; it is decorated , and filled with small toys or candy , or both , and then broken as part of a ceremony or celebration . Piñatas are commonly associated with Mexico . The idea of breaking a container filled with treats came to Europe in the 14th century , where the name , from the Italian pignatta , was introduced . The Spanish brought the European tradition to Mexico , although there were similar traditions in Mesoamerica , such as the Aztecs ' honoring the birthday of the god Huitzilopochtli in mid December . According to local records , the Mexican piñata tradition began in the town of Acolman , just north of Mexico City , where piñatas were introduced for catechism purposes as well as to co-opt the Huitzilopochtli ceremony . Today , the piñata is still part of Mexican culture , the cultures of other countries in Latin America , as well as the United States , but it has mostly lost its religious character . </P>	['treats']	treats

Elizabeth meets with Churchill to discuss Philip 's requests that his family keep the name Mountbatten and live at Clarence House rather than move into Buckingham Palace . The Prime Minister displays a reluctance to bend to either request , but Elizabeth later drops them after receiving counsel from Edward .

He makes an impassioned speech outside the hospital where Venetia 's body is being held , promising a longer - term approach to preventing future smog .

when did they stop cigarette advertising on television	<P> After World War II , cigarette companies advertised frequently on television programs . To combat this move by the cigarette companies , the Federal Communications Commission required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements at no cost to the organizations providing such advertisements . In 1970 , Congress took their anti-smoking initiative one step further and passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act , banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio starting on January 2 , 1971 . After the television ban , most cigarette advertising took place in magazines , newspapers , and on billboards . However , in 1999 all cigarette billboard advertisements were replaced with anti-smoking messages , with some of these anti-smoking messages playing parodies of cigarette companies advertising figures and slogans . Since 1984 , cigarette companies have also been forced to place Surgeon 's General warnings on all cigarette packs and advertisements because of the passing of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act . Restrictions on cigarette companies became even tighter in 2010 with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act . The act prohibits tobacco companies from sponsoring sports , music , and other cultural events and also prevents the display of their logos or products on T - shirts , hats , or other apparel . The constitutionality of both this act and the Food and Drug Administration 's new graphic cigarette warning labels are being questioned under cigarette companies ' first amendment rights . </P>	['January 2 , 1971']	January 2 , 1971

who did puerto rico belong to before the u.s	<P> Originally populated by the indigenous Taíno people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for Spain during his second voyage . Later it endured invasion attempts from the French , Dutch , and British . Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island 's cultural landscapes with waves of African slaves , Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and the mainland parts of New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Native Americans , Africans , and Iberians . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris . The treaty took effect on April 11 , 1899 . </P>	['Spain']	Spain

who was the last nba player to get drafted out of high school	<P> The terms of the new agreement ended the practice of drafting high school players , starting in the 2006 Draft . A high school player must wait at least a year to be eligible for selection . However , they are not required to spend that year in college . In 2008 , high school star Brandon Jennings decided to skip college and play professional basketball in Italy . After a year , he was eligible for the 2009 draft and was selected 10th by the Milwaukee Bucks . In the 2010 draft , Latavious Williams , who did not qualify academically to go to college , spent a year playing in the NBA D - League before he was drafted in the second round . Emmanuel Mudiay decided to take a route similar to that of Brandon Jennings by skipping college to play professionally in China in 2014 before being selected by the Denver Nuggets at pick 7 a year later . In the 2015 draft , Satnam Singh Bhamara , who did not qualify academically to go to college , went straight to the NBA draft as a post-graduate after being at IMG Academy for five years . He would be taken by the Dallas Mavericks with the 52nd pick in the draft , thus becoming the first high school student to be drafted since the rule changes . In the 2016 draft , one of the Top -- 10 players that was declared eligible for NCAA play in 2016 , Thon Maker , decided to enter the draft instead as a post-graduate from Orangeville Prep in Orangeville , Ontario , Canada due to him originally declaring himself as eligible for college in 2015 . Thon would also mark the first player to be drafted directly from a Canadian high school , as well as the second player to enter as a post-graduate . He 'd also be the first high schooler to be drafted in the first round since 2005 , being drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks with the tenth pick in the draft , thus becoming the first high school lottery pick since 2005 . Most recently , in the 2018 draft , both Anfernee Simons and Thon 's brother , Matur Maker , are also looking to be drafted in the NBA , with Simons being a postgraduate and Maker 's decision relating to him being held back a year . </P>	['Thon Maker']	Thon Maker

what is the center of heredity in a cell	<P> Between 1877 and 1878 , Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs , showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus . This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a ( single ) nucleated cell . This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity . The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later , after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century ; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed . </P>	['nucleus']	nucleus

when did 10 shilling note go out of circulation	<P> A new design for ten - shilling notes was introduced in 1961 , with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962 .

where was the original planet of the apes filmed at	<P> The script was originally written by Rod Serling , but underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began . Directors J. Lee Thompson and Blake Edwards were approached , but the film 's producer Arthur P. Jacobs , upon the recommendation of Charlton Heston , chose Franklin J. Schaffner to direct the film . Schaffner 's changes included an ape society less advanced -- and therefore less expensive to depict -- than that of the original novel . Filming took place between May 21 and August 10 , 1967 , in California , Utah and Arizona , with desert sequences shot in and around Lake Powell , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area . The film 's final `` closed '' cost was $5.8 million . </P>	['California', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'Lake Powell , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area']	California
who is the guy that jumped from space	<P> Felix Baumgartner ( German : ( ˈfeːlɪks ˈbaʊ̯mˌɡaɐ̯tnɐ ) ; born 20 April 1969 ) is an Austrian skydiver , daredevil , and BASE jumper . He is best known for jumping to Earth from a helium balloon in the stratosphere on 14 October 2012 . Doing so , he set world records for skydiving an estimated 39 km ( 24 mi ) , reaching an estimated top speed of 1,357.64 km / h ( 843.6 mph ) , or Mach 1.25 . He became the first person to break the sound barrier without vehicular power relative to the surface on his descent .

Though he still holds the two latter records , the first was broken two years later , when on 24 October 2014 , Alan Eustace jumped from 135,890 feet -- or , 41.42 km ( 25.74 mi ) with a drogue . </P>	['Felix Baumgartner']	Felix Baumgartner
what is the average time in hospice care	<P> Many physicians are slow to refer to hospice care , waiting until they are absolutely certain of a terminal prognosis . Some physicians believe that the patient must have a six - month prognosis or less to receive hospice care , while others are overly optimistic in their assessment of prognosis , presuming treatment will be more effective than it is . As a result , the majority of patients are referred to hospice in the very end - stages of their diseases , or choose that time to seek hospice care . The average length of stay in hospice before a patient dies was 26 days in 1994 and 19 days in 1998 . Although the length of average stays has since increased , the term of care continues to be underused . In 2004 the average stay was 57 days and the median length was 22 days . 33 % of hospice patients admitted in 2004 died within seven days of admission . </P>	['57 days']	57 days

when did hollywood become the centre of the film industry	<P> By 1912 , major motion - picture companies had set up production near or in Los Angeles .

where are the cardiac and vasomotor centers found	<P> The vasomotor center ( VMC ) is a portion of the medulla oblongata that , together with the cardiovascular center and respiratory center , regulates blood pressure and other homeostatic processes . Vasomotor center is a fairly archaic term since this function relies not on a single brain structure ( `` center '' ) but rather represents a presympathetic network of interacting neurons . Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors , it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels . This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation , especially in the brain . Cranial nerves IX ( Glossopharyngeal nerve ) and X Vagus nerve both feed into the vasomotor centre and are themselves involved in the regulation of blood pressure . The localization of VMC was determined by Filipp Ovsyannikov in 1871 . </P>	['medulla oblongata']	medulla oblongata

who proposed evolution in 1859 as the basis of biological development	<P> In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory , explained in detail in Darwin 's On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) . Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics . During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields , resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology -- the modern synthesis . </P>	['Charles Darwin']	Charles Darwin

where are mucosal associated lymphoid tissues present in the human body and why	<P> The mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) , also called mucosa - associated lymphatic tissue , is a diffuse system of small concentrations of lymphoid tissue found in various submucosal membrane sites of the body , such as the gastrointestinal tract , oral passage , nasopharyngeal tract , thyroid , breast , lung , salivary glands , eye , and skin . MALT is populated by lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells , as well as plasma cells and macrophages , each of which is well situated to encounter antigens passing through the mucosal epithelium . In the case of intestinal MALT , M cells are also present , which sample antigen from the lumen and deliver it to the lymphoid tissue . </P>	['gastrointestinal tract', 'oral passage', 'nasopharyngeal tract', 'thyroid', 'breast', 'lung', 'salivary glands', 'eye', 'skin']	gastrointestinal tract

who was originally cast to play indiana jones	<P> Originally , Spielberg suggested Harrison Ford ; Lucas resisted the idea , since he had already cast the actor in American Graffiti , Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back , and did not want Ford to become known as his `` Bobby De Niro '' ( in reference to the fact that fellow director Martin Scorsese regularly casts Robert De Niro in his films ) . During an intensive casting process , Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors , and finally cast actor Tom Selleck as Indiana Jones . Shortly afterward pre-production began in earnest on Raiders of the Lost Ark . However , CBS refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to Magnum , P.I. ( which was gradually gaining momentum in the ratings ) , forcing him to turn down the role . One of CBS 's concerns was that shooting for Magnum P.I. conflicted with shooting for Raiders , both of which were to begin about the same time . However , Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for Magnum P.I. was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for Raiders had concluded . </P>	['Tom Selleck']	Tom Selleck
when was the first temple built in jerusalem	<P> The only source of information on the First Temple is the Tanakh . According to the biblical sources , the temple was constructed under Solomon , during the united monarchy of Israel and Judah . The Bible describes Hiram I of Tyre who furnished architects , workmen and cedar timbers for the temple of his ally Solomon at Jerusalem . He also co-operated with Solomon in mounting an expedition on the Red Sea . 1 Kings 6 : 1 puts the date of the beginning of building the temple `` in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel '' . The conventional dates of Solomon 's reign are circa 970 to 931 BCE . This puts the date of its construction in the mid-10th century BCE . Schmid and Rupprecht are of the view that the site of the temple used to be a Jebusite shrine which Solomon chose in an attempt to unify the Jebusites and Israelites. 1 Kings 9 : 10 says that it took Solomon 20 years altogether to build the Temple and his royal palace . The Temple itself finished being built after 7 years . During the united monarchy the Temple was dedicated to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and housed the Ark of the Covenant . Rabbinic sources state that the First Temple stood for 410 years and , based on the 2nd - century work Seder Olam Rabbah , place construction in 832 BCE and destruction in 422 BCE ( 3338 AM ) , 165 years later than secular estimates . </P>	['the mid-10th century BCE']	the mid-10th century BCE

why the hole in the ozone layer over antarctica	<P> At Montreal , the participants agreed to freeze production of CFCs at 1986 levels and to reduce production by 50 percent by 1999 . After a series of scientific expeditions to the Antarctic produced convincing evidence that the ozone hole was indeed caused by chlorine and bromine from manmade organohalogens , the Montreal Protocol was strengthened at a 1990 meeting in London . The participants agreed to phase out CFCs and halons entirely ( aside from a very small amount marked for certain `` essential '' uses , such as asthma inhalers ) by 2000 in non-Article 5 countries and by 2010 in Article 5 ( less developed ) signatories . At a 1992 meeting in Copenhagen , the phase - out date was moved up to 1996 . At the same meeting , methyl bromide ( MeBr ) , a fumigant used primarily in agricultural production , was added to the list of controlled substances . For all substances controlled under the protocol , phaseout schedules were delayed for less developed ( ' Article 5 ( 1 ) ' ) countries , and phaseout in these countries was supported by transfers of expertise , technology , and money from non-Article 5 ( 1 ) Parties to the Protocol . Additionally , exemptions from the agreed schedules could be applied for under the Essential Use Exemption ( EUE ) process for substances other than methyl bromide and under the Critical Use Exemption ( CUE ) process for methyl bromide . </P>	['chlorine', 'bromine', 'CFCs', 'halons', 'methyl bromide']	chlorine

who opens the church of the holy sepulchre	<P> According to tradition , the Nusaybah family took its name from a female companion or Sahabah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad named Nusaybah bint Ka'ab . She was a member of the Ansar who transferred their political power over Medina to the prophet . Nusaybah fought along with Muhammed in battle and was an early example of women taking leadership roles in Islam . Since the arrival of Islam in Jerusalem in the seventh century , the Sunni Muslim family has held the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre alongside the Joudeh Al - Goudia family ( who were added to the original arrangement in the time of Saladin , the Muslim conqueror who seized the holy city from the Crusaders in 1187 ) . This arrangement emerged during the days of the second Sunni caliph Umar Ibn al - Khattab , who hoped to avoid clashes among rival Christian sects for control over the church . Although symbolic , the arrangement has provided the stability the Christians of the city needed , and is a symbol of tolerance and inter-religious harmony , and gave the Nusaybah family a visible role in Christian activities in Jerusalem , which include pilgrimages and visits by Western Christians . </P>	['the Nusaybah family', 'the Joudeh Al - Goudia family']	the Nusaybah family

what happens to water that infiltrates the soil if it is not absorbed by the roots of plants	<P> Infiltration is the process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil . Infiltration rate in soil science is a measure of the rate at which soil is able to absorb rainfall or irrigation . It is most often measured in millimetres per hour or inches per hour . The rate decreases as the soil becomes saturated . If the precipitation rate exceeds the infiltration rate , runoff will usually occur unless there is some physical barrier . It is related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the near - surface soil . The rate of infiltration can be measured using an infiltrometer . </P>	['runoff']	runoff

the mughal garden of rashtrapati bhavan is modelled on which garden	<P> The founder of the Mughal empire , Babur , described his favourite type of garden as a charbagh . They use the term bāgh , baug , bageecha or bagicha for garden . This word developed a new meaning in India , as Babur explains ; India lacked the fast - flowing streams required for the Central Asian charbagh . The Agra garden , which was renamed after Partition of India as the Ram Bagh , since it lied in Hindu majority portion is thought to have been the first charbagh . India , Bangladesh and Pakistan have a number of Mughal gardens which differ from their Central Asian predecessors with respect to `` the highly disciplined geometry '' . An early textual references about Mughal gardens are found in the memoirs and biographies of the Mughal emperors , including those of Babur , Humayun and Akbar . Later references are found from `` the accounts of India '' written by various European travellers ( Bernier for example ) . The first serious historical study of Mughal gardens was written by Constance Villiers - Stuart , with the title Gardens of the Great Mughals ( 1913 ) . Her husband was a Colonel in Britain 's Indian army . This gave her a good network of contacts and an opportunity to travel . During their residence at Pinjore Gardens , Mrs. Villiers - Stuart also had an opportunity to direct the maintenance of an important Mughal garden . Her book makes reference to the forthcoming design of a garden in the Government House at New Delhi ( now known as Rashtrapati Bhavan ) . She was consulted by Edwin Lutyens , and this may have influenced his choice of Mughal style for this project . Recent scholarly work on the history of Mughal gardens has been carried out under the auspicious guidance of Dumbarton Oaks ( including Mughal Gardens : Sources , Places , Representations , and Prospects edited by James L. Wescoat , Jr. and Joachim Wolschke - Bulmahn ) and the Smithsonian Institution . Some examples of Mughal gardens are Shalimar Gardens ( Lahore ) , Lalbagh Fort at Dhaka , and Shalimar Bagh ( Srinagar ) . </P>	['charbagh']	charbagh

what does the adrenal gland produce that is necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function	<P> Sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels , including many of those in the skin , the digestive tract , and the kidneys . This occurs as a result of activation of alpha - 1 adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons . These receptors exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta - 2 adrenergic receptors ( stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands ) in the skeletal muscles , the heart , the lungs , and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response . The net effect of this is a shunting of blood away from the organs not necessary to the immediate survival of the organism and an increase in blood flow to those organs involved in intense physical activity . </P>	['epinephrine']	epinephrine

This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life . Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839 . This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann .

1. what was the precursor to the present day internet	<P> The Internet protocol suite ( TCP / IP ) was developed by Robert E. Kahn and Vint Cerf in the 1970s and became the standard networking protocol on the ARPANET , incorporating concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin . In the early 1980s the NSF funded the establishment for national supercomputing centers at several universities , and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project , which also created network access to the supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations . Commercial Internet service providers ( ISPs ) began to emerge in the very late 1980s . The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990 . Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 1990 , and the NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995 , removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic . </P>	['the ARPANET project']	the ARPANET project

who is credited with creating the gothic art movement	<P> Gothic art emerged in Île - de-France , France , in the early 12th century at the Abbey Church of St Denis built by Abbot Suger . The style rapidly spread beyond its origins in architecture to sculpture , both monumental and personal in size , textile art , and painting , which took a variety of forms , including fresco , stained glass , the illuminated manuscript , and panel painting . Monastic orders , especially the Cistercians and the Carthusians , were important builders who disseminated the style and developed distinctive variants of it across Europe .

what is the central idea of the poem the rime of ancient mariner	<P> On a surface level the poem explores a violation of nature and the resulting psychological effects on the mariner and on all those who hear him . According to Jerome McGann the poem is like a salvation story . The poem 's structure is multi-layered text based on Coleridge 's interest in Higher Criticism . `` Like the Iliad or Paradise Lost or any great historical product , the Rime is a work of transhistorical rather than so - called universal significance .

who played harley in harley davidson and the marlboro man	<P> The film is set in Los Angeles in the then - future of 1996 . Harley Davidson ( Mickey Rourke ) , dressed in biker gear , with ultra-short dyed hair , hears from the radio about a dangerous new street drug named `` Crystal Dream '' . ( The significance of this street drug does not become clear until later . ) Harley goes into a rough bar and sees a cowboy - looking fellow ( Don Johnson wearing a beard , cowboy hat and boots ) . He has scammed a fellow in a pool game but has to use strong measures when the fellow refuses payment . Harley helps him in this . We learn that they are old friends ( later we learn the name he goes by is The Marlboro Man . ) They visit a blues ( old jazz ? ) bar in Burbank , which they both hold special . They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels , an extremely - heavily - muscled lad , who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over a woman . After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley . Marlboro borrows Harley 's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop , with interesting results . In a bit of psychological revelation , we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with a beautiful woman , who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man , as she is not getting enough loving from him . He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank . Showing considerable balls , Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually - fascinating airplane graveyard , but then the bank 's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty , although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money . In a running battle , Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily - declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank . The closing scene : Marlboro has gone back to rodeo bull - riding and Harley on his bike takes to the road , stopping only temporarily to pick up a ravishing and shapely hitchhiker who tells him she is going `` no place special '' , a destination that Harley promises to take her . Much of the film was filmed in and around Tucson , Arizona and the `` Boneyard '' at Davis - Monthan Air Force Base . </P>	['Mickey Rourke']	Mickey Rourke

bacterial cell walls are made rigid by the presence of	<P> Peptidoglycan , also known as murein , is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a mesh - like layer outside the plasma membrane of most bacteria , forming the cell wall . The sugar component consists of alternating residues of β - ( 1 , 4 ) linked N - acetylglucosamine ( NAG ) and N - acetylmuramic acid ( NAM ) . Attached to the N - acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids . The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh - like layer . Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall , giving structural strength , as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm . A common misconception is that peptidoglycan gives the cell its shape ; however , whereas peptidoglycan helps maintain the structural strength of the cell , it is actually the MreB protein that facilitates cell shape . Peptidoglycan is also involved in binary fission during bacterial cell reproduction . </P>	['Peptidoglycan']	Peptidoglycan

These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the `` twisted ladder '' or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides . Adenine is always paired with thymine , and guanine is always paired with cytosine . These are known as base pairs . Uracil is only present in RNA , replacing thymine . Pyrimidines include thymine , cytosine , and uracil . They have a single ring structure . Purines include adenine and guanine .

what were the two causes of the dust bowl	<P> The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . </P>	['severe drought', 'failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion']	severe drought

His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system , preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing . More specifically , the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines , especially norepinephrine and epinephrine . The hormones estrogen , testosterone , and cortisol , as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin , also affect how organisms react to stress . </P>	['the adrenal medulla']	the adrenal medulla

what was the united states foreign policy after ww1 started	<P> American foreign policy was largely determined by President Woodrow Wilson , who had shown little interest in foreign affairs before entering the White House in 1913 . His chief advisor was `` Colonel '' Edward House , who was sent on many top - level missions . With the outbreak of war in 1914 , the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace . It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 . After the failure of the German spring offensive , as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day , the Germans were in a hopeless position , and surrendered . Coupled with Wilson 's Fourteen Points in January 1918 , the U.S. now had the initiative on the military , diplomatic and public relations fronts . Wilsonianism -- Wilson 's ideals -- had become the hope of the world , including the civilian population Germany itself . </P>	['neutrality']	neutrality

who was mr.owen in and then there were none	<Li> Justice Lawrence John Wargrave , a retired judge , known as a `` hanging judge '' for liberally awarding the death penalty in murder cases . Wargrave is accused of influencing the jury to hand a guilty verdict to Edward Seton , a man many thought was innocent of his crime of killing an old woman , and sentencing him to death unfairly . However , as the two policemen discuss at Scotland Yard , new evidence after Seton 's execution proved he was unmistakably guilty . He admits in his postscript that he has a lifelong hidden sadistic urge to cause death , but felt bound only to indulge it with guilty persons , and a lifelong wish to create a masterpiece of a mystery . Finding himself terminally ill , he creates a game in which , as island owner `` U.N. Owen '' ( i.e. , `` Unknown '' ) , he entices to an island various people who have been responsible for the deaths of other people , but escaped justice , through a third party agent , Isaac Morris , in order to be a murderer himself , and kill his `` guests '' in a way that would leave an almost - unsolvable mystery . After the deaths , he arranges the island so that each death appears to have a survivor . However out of what he admits is a `` pitiful human need '' for recognition , he also writes a confession , which he throws in the sea , and leaves to chance whether it will be found . His final act is to shoot himself in a way that matches the description of his death in some of the other guests ' diaries , by using a rubber cord and handkerchief wrapped around the gun when he shoots himself in the head ; the elastic will separate and attract no attention , and the gun and cloth will recoil a sufficient distance from him to avoid any suspicion of the true circumstances by the police . </Li>	['Justice Lawrence John Wargrave']	Justice Lawrence John Wargrave

when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario	<P> In North American residential construction , aluminum wire was used for wiring entire houses for a short time from the 1960s to the mid-1970s during a period of high copper prices . Electrical devices ( outlets , switches , lighting , fans , etc . ) at the time were not designed with the particular properties of the aluminum wire being used in mind , and there were some issues related to the properties of the wire itself , making the installations with aluminum wire much more susceptible to problems . Revised manufacturing standards for both the wire and the devices were developed to reduce the problems . Existing homes with this older aluminum wiring used in branch circuits present a potential fire hazard . </P>	['mid-1970s']	mid-1970s

this type of nuclear decay effectively turns a proton into a neutron	<P> In nuclear physics , beta decay ( β - decay ) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray ( fast energetic electron or positron ) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus . For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive . </P>	['beta decay']	beta decay

where does a brisket come from on a cow	<P> Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal . The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts , though the precise definition of the cut differs internationally . The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals . As cattle do not have collar bones , these muscles support about 60 % of the body weight of standing / moving cattle . This requires a significant amount of connective tissue , so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue . </P>	['the breast or lower chest']	the breast or lower chest

when was the last time mount etna exploded	<P> Eruptions of Etna follow a variety of patterns . Most occur at the summit , where there are currently ( as of 2008 ) five distinct craters -- the Northeast Crater , the Voragine , the Bocca Nuova , and the Southeast Crater Complex ( 2 ) . Other eruptions occur on the flanks , which have more than 300 vents ranging in size from small holes in the ground to large craters hundreds of metres across . Summit eruptions can be highly explosive and spectacular , but rarely threaten the inhabited areas around the volcano . In contrast , flank eruptions can occur down to a few hundred metres altitude , close to or even well within the inhabited areas . Numerous villages and small towns lie around or on cones of past flank eruptions . Since the year AD 1600 , at least 60 flank eruptions and countless summit eruptions have occurred ; nearly half of these have happened since the start of the 20th century . Since 2000 , Etna has had four flank eruptions -- in 2001 , 2002 -- 2003 , 2004 -- 2005 , and 2008 -- 2009 . Summit eruptions occurred in 2006 , 2007 -- 2008 , January -- April 2012 , and again in July -- October 2012 . </P>	['16 March 2017']	16 March 2017

when did ireland gain its independence from england	<P> In 1922 , after the Irish War of Independence and the Anglo - Irish Treaty , most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom to become the independent Irish Free State , which after the 1937 constitution , began to call itself Ireland . The six northeastern counties , known as Northern Ireland , remained within the United Kingdom . The Irish Civil War followed soon after the War of Independence . The history of Northern Ireland has since been dominated by sporadic sectarian conflict between ( mainly Catholic ) Irish nationalists and ( mainly Protestant ) unionists . This conflict erupted into the Troubles in the late 1960s , until peace was achieved with the Belfast Agreement thirty years later . </P>	['1922']	1922

who sang buddy can you spare a dime	<P> `` Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' , also sung as `` Buddy , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' , is one of the best - known American songs of the Great Depression . Written in 1930 by lyricist E.Y. `` Yip '' Harburg and composer Jay Gorney , `` Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' was part of the 1932 musical revue Americana ; the melody is based on a Russian - Jewish lullaby Gorney 's mother had sung to him as a child . It was considered by Republicans to be anti-capitalist propaganda , and almost dropped from the show ; attempts were made to ban it from the radio . The song became best known , however , through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee . They were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's election to the presidency . The Brunswick Crosby recording made on October 25 , 1932 with Lennie Hayton and his Orchestra became the best - selling record of its period , and came to be viewed as an anthem to the shattered dreams of the era . </P>	['Bing Crosby', 'Rudy Vallee']	Bing Crosby

who is the all time leading scorer in ncaa tournament history	<P> Additionally , several of the players on this list played during an era when college freshmen were ineligible to compete at the varsity level and were forced to participate on either freshman or junior varsity teams . Since freshman and junior varsity points do not count toward official NCAA records , three players -- Pete Maravich , Oscar Robertson and Elvin Hayes -- only had three seasons to compile their totals . Larry Bird redshirted ( sat out ) his freshman year , and therefore , like Maravich , Robertson , and Hayes , his totals also cover only three seasons ( though in Bird 's case , unlike the others , it was his own choice not to play a fourth season at the college level ) . With the added benefits of a three - point line and a full extra year of varsity eligibility , their already - historical statistics would have been much higher . Maravich , a guard from LSU , not only owns the three highest single season averages in Division I history , but also the highest career total . Remarkably , he scored 3,667 points ( over 400 more than the next closest player ) in a mere 83 games . His record is considered nearly unbreakable ; the only player who could have potentially overtaken him as the top scorer in Division I history is Stephen Curry of Davidson , who had scored 2,635 points through his first three seasons of college basketball . However , Curry opted to forgo his final year of NCAA eligibility and moved on to the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) following his junior season in 2008 -- 09 . </P>	['Pete Maravich']	Pete Maravich

who started ww2 and how did it start	<P> The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937 , but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth , with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz bombing campaign , and the Balkan Campaign , as well as the long - running Battle of the Atlantic . On 22 June 1941 , the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union , opening the largest land theatre of war in history , which trapped the major part of the Axis military forces into a war of attrition .

new mexico was admitted to the union as the . . . state	<P> Inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years before European exploration , it was colonized by the Spanish in 1598 as part of the Imperial Spanish viceroyalty of New Spain . It was named Nuevo México after the Aztec Valley of Mexico by Spanish settlers , 223 years before the establishment of the present - day country of Mexico . The present - day state of New Mexico was not named after , nor is it a part of , Mexico . Its geographic characteristics made settlement and effective political control difficult which prompted Mexico 's invasion and control of the area from 1824 to 1846 . New Mexico 's Spanish origins made cultural integration with Mexico unsuitable , which sparked the Revolt of 1837 and a growing economic association with the expanding United States .

who was the first imperial power that was fighting in vietnam	<P> Full - scale war broke out between the Việt Minh and France in late 1946 and the First Indochina War officially began . Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide , France decided to bring former emperor Bảo Đại back to power , as a political alternative to Ho Chi Minh . A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948 , reuniting Annam and Tonkin , but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina 's legal status . In July 1949 , the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed , as a semi-independent country within the French Union , with Bảo Đại as Head of State . France was finally persuaded to relinquish its colonies in Indochina in 1954 when Viet Minh forces defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu . The 1954 Geneva Conference left Vietnam a divided nation , with Hồ Chí Minh 's communist DRV government ruling the North from Hanoi and Ngô Đình Diệm 's Republic of Vietnam , supported by the United States , ruling the South from Saigon . Between 1953 and 1956 , the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms , including `` rent reduction '' and `` land reform '' , which resulted in significant political oppression . During the land reform , testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents , which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions . Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area , a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time . However , declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time , although likely greater than 13,500 . In the South , Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition , imprisoning or killing tens of thousands . </P>	['France']	France

who discovered one of the first taxonomic classification schemes	<P> Taxonomy ( from Ancient Greek τάξις ( taxis ) , meaning ' arrangement ' , and - νομία ( - nomia ) , meaning ' method ' ) is the science of defining and naming groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics . Organisms are grouped together into taxa ( singular : taxon ) and these groups are given a taxonomic rank ; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super-group of higher rank , thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy . The principal ranks in modern use are domain , kingdom , phylum ( division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum ) , class , order , family , genus and species . The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the father of taxonomy , as he developed a system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorization of organisms and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms . </P>	['Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus']	Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus
what is the term of an official in the house of representatives	<P> The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of Representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all Representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty - three representatives .

who came up with the initial concept of protons and neutrons	<P> Given the problems of the proton -- electron model , it was quickly accepted that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons , although the precise nature of the neutron was initially unclear . Within months after the discovery of the neutron , Werner Heisenberg and Dmitri Ivanenko had proposed proton -- neutron models for the nucleus . Heisenberg 's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics . While Heisenberg 's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a `` major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system , '' he still assumed the presence of nuclear electrons . In particular , Heisenberg assumed the neutron was a proton -- electron composite , for which there is no quantum mechanical explanation . Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus . Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons . He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle , i.e. , nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear isospin quantum numbers . </P>	['Werner Heisenberg', 'Dmitri Ivanenko']	Werner Heisenberg
