The committee in general , and Jefferson in particular , thought that Adams should write the document , but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally . Considering Congress 's busy schedule , Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days , and likely wrote the draft quickly . He then consulted the others and made some changes , and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations . The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28 , 1776 . The title of the document was `` A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America , in General Congress assembled . '' </P>\",\n",

Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work .

These elements , including the Yule log from Yule and gift giving from Saturnalia , became syncretized into Christmas over the centuries . The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday 's inception , ranging from a sometimes raucous , drunken , carnival - like state in the Middle Ages , to a tamer family - oriented and children - centered theme introduced in a 19th - century transformation . In fact , the celebration of Christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain Protestant groups , such as the Puritans , due to concerns that it was too pagan or unbiblical .

New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped - down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock .

Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism .

General elections occur every two to six years ( depending on the positions being filled with most positions good for four years ) and include the presidential election , but unlike parliamentary systems the term can also refer to special elections that fill out positions prematurely vacated by the previous office holder ( e.g. through death , resignation , etc . ) . Some parallels can be drawn between the general election in parliamentary systems and the biennial elections determining all House seats , although there is no analogue to `` calling early elections '' in the U.S. , and the members of the elected U.S. Senate face elections of only one - third at a time at two - year intervals including during a general election . </P>\",\n",

       "  'gold_ctx': \"<P> Daenerys Targaryen ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Emilia Clarke . Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution . After she receives too many complaints about her dragons , Daenerys , locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon . Meanwhile , Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy , a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied . She considers freeing her dragons , but they attempt to attack her , making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her . After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy , Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive , but Barristan tells her of the Mad King 's actions against his enemies , which included burning them with wildfire while laughing . He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial , and she agrees with him . Mossador goes against her wishes , and kills the captive Son of the Harpy . Daenerys has him publicly executed , which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves . At night , Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned , but when she tries to touch his face , he flies away . Soon afterward , a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway . The Unsullied head in to investigate , but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy . The Unsullied attempt to fight back , but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them . Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help , killing many of the Sons of the Harpy , but gets badly wounded , and dies . Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries . Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan , and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses . She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward . The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal , and he and Viserion eat him . Daenerys then has all the lords arrested , including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq , whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles . To respect the culture of the region , she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated ( she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport ) . Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition . Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed , and gets up to leave , but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them . This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont , who is trying to win over Daenerys ' favor after being banished . Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away , but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift , and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys . After a round of questioning , Daenerys banishes Jorah once again , but takes Tyrion on as her adviser . On the great opening of Daznak 's Pit , Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena , but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life . Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy , who appear in legions and attack Daenerys ' guards . Cornered at the midst of the arena , defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns , killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears . Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back , riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd . She roams the Great Steppe north of the city , where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food . Strolling about on her own , Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers , and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail , she is surrounded . In season 6 , the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak , where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo 's former wife . Out of respect for Dothraki traditions , they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen , which consisted of the wives of deceased khals . Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside . She emerges unscathed , and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader . She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons . In the aftermath , Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron . Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne , names Tyrion as her hand , but breaks up with Daario , ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver 's Bay in her absence . With her new army , Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros . In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle , annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire . Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone , seeing him as a friend and ally , insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal . She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass ( obsidian ) from her land . When Jon 's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them , and is devastated when the Night King kills one . On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love . </P>\",\n",

The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 .

Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) , Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life -- from sex to relationships -- through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . </P>\",\n",

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds .

His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' .

However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 .

Unlike his on - screen character , McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits ; instead he worked with their scale doubles . </Li> <Li> Sean Astin as Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee : a hobbit gardener and Frodo 's best friend . Astin , who had recently become a father , bonded with the 18 - year - old Wood in a protective manner , which mirrored Sam 's relationship with Frodo . </Li> <Li> Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn II Elessar : a Dúnedain ranger , the descendant of Isildur , and heir to Gondor 's throne . Daniel Day - Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production , but turned it down . Nicolas Cage also received an offer , declining because of `` family obligations '' , while Vin Diesel , a fan of the book , auditioned for Aragorn . Stuart Townsend was cast in the role , before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young . Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement , but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in Gladiator . Day - Lewis was offered the role for a second time , but declined again . Executive Producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play . Mortensen 's son , a fan of the book , convinced him to take the role . Mortensen read the book on the plane , received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop . Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume and carrying his `` hero '' sword around with him off - camera . </Li> <Li> Billy Boyd as Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took : a hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor . </Li> <Li> Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck : a distant cousin of Frodo . Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo . </Li> <Li> John Rhys - Davies as Gimli : a dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell and a descendant of Durin 's Folk . Billy Connolly , who was considered for the part of Gimli , later portrayed Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson 's The Hobbit film trilogy . Rhys - Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli , which limited his vision , and eventually developed eczema around his eyes . </Li> <Li> Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf : a prince of the elves ' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer . Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir , who appears in the second film , a role which went to David Wenham . </Li> <Li> Sean Bean as Boromir : a prince of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor . Bruce Willis , a fan of the book , expressed interest in the role , while Liam Neeson was sent the script , but passed . </Li> <Li> Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins : Frodo 's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell . Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of The Lord of the Rings , and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance . Sylvester McCoy , who would later play Radagast the Brown in The Hobbit , was contacted about playing the role , and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm . </Li> <Li> Liv Tyler as Arwen Undomiel : a beautiful half - elf princess of Rivendell and Aragorn 's lover . The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane , and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film . Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role . Peter Jackson wanted to cast Uma Thurman as Arwen , but Thurman pulled out due to pregnancy , Tyler came to shoot on short occasions , unlike the rest of the actors . She was one of the last actors to be cast , on 25 August 1999 . </Li> <Li> Cate Blanchett as Galadriel : the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn . Peter Jackson wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel , but she declined due to pregnancy . </Li> <Li> Christopher Lee as Saruman the White : the fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron 's will through his use of the palantír. Lee was a major fan of the book , and read it once a year . He had also met J.R.R. Tolkien . He originally auditioned for Gandalf , but was judged too old . </Li> <Li> Hugo Weaving as Elrond : the elven Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond , which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring . David Bowie expressed interest in the role , but Jackson stated , `` To have a famous , beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable . '' </Li> <Li> Sala Baker as Sauron : the Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring 's true master who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form . Originally hired as one of the several stunt performers for the film trilogy , Baker ended up landing the role . In addition , he went on to play several Orcs as well . </Li> <Li> Andy Serkis as Gollum voice and motion capture : a wretched hobbit - like creature whose mind was poisoned over centuries by the Ring . </Li> <Li> David Weatherley as Barliman Butterbur , proprietor in Bree </Li> <Li> Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz : the commander of Saruman 's Orc forces ; </Li> <Li> Marton Csokas as Celeborn : the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside his wife Galadriel ; </Li> <Li> Craig Parker as Haldir : the leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien ; </Li> <Li> Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil - galad , the last Elven - King of Noldor ; </Li> <Li> Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall : the last High King of Arnor and Gondor ; </Li> <Li> Harry Sinclair as Isildur : Elendil 's son and Aragorn 's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron . </Li> <Li> Peter Jackson as Albert Dreary : a man of Bree . </Li> </Ul>\",\n",

Even universities were made `` tribal '' , and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools . Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans . In 1959 , this type of education was extended to `` non white '' universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act , and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system . It is often argued that the policy of Bantu ( African ) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market , although Hendrik Verwoerd , at the time Minister of Native Affairs , claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa 's `` ethnic problems '' by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups . </P>\",\n",

One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation .

Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles .

       "  'gold_ctx': \"<P> The ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century . By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . </P>\",\n",

This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid , and it could easily be sawn into sticks . It remains the only large - scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form . Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead . Consequently , it was called plumbago ( Latin for `` lead ore '' ) .

Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not . However , the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws , considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees . </P>\",\n",

The trio tries to break the UK speed record for amphibious vehicles by building one of their own . Clarkson oversees his idea of combining a Rolls - Royce Spey turbofan engine from a Nimrod jet and a speedboat with a Suzuki Jimny . However on a nearby lake , Clarkson and May have to abort their run after achieving only 3 mph ( 5 km / h ) and nearly sinking . Hammond and May then go on to build a vehicle of their own by combining a Bond Bug with the engine of a personal water craft nicknaming it the `` Pond Bug \\'\\' .

May abandons his Velar for his boat , which sinks , causing him to lose the race .

After unsuccessfully trying to catch fish using local methods , they buy fish at a local market . Early in the journey , Clarkson \\'s truck crashes into May \\'s car upon rescuing it , damaging its radiator grille . Deeper into rural Mozambique , May constantly soaks himself with sea water from his ill - fitted tank and , due to his damaged radiator grille , suffers multiple breakdowns due to water intrusion . Hammond loses a large number of his fish on the bumpy roads , constantly gets stuck in thick mud and endlessly falls from his motorbike . Clarkson suffers very few issues except when his ice machine breaks , causing him to make small adjustments to his truck in order to smoke the fish with his exhaust . Upon May \\'s car breaking down in the middle of a lake , despite Hammond and Clarkson crossing successfully , Clarkson cuts off the front end of the Mercedes and tows what remains of the rear portion using his truck - much to May \\'s dismay and annoyance . Eventually , the three reach Bingo with May \\'s fish dead , Clarkson \\'s fish ruined and Hammond having almost no fish left . As a result , they sell no fish and leave Bingo in a helicopter `` like all charitable celebrities \\'\\' . </Td> </Tr> </Table>',\n",

Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue .

In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand ; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations . A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling , and renewable energies emerged . The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and ' 80s , primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity , presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation , the first large - scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and ' 90s .

In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 . On December 7 , 1917 , the U.S. declared war on Austria - Hungary . U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918 . </P>\",\n",

Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year .

This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent , and it dies out . The vaporization of water also absorbs heat ; it thereby cools the smoke , air , walls , and objects that could act as further fuel , and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow , which is by `` jumping '' to nearby heat / fuel sources to start new fires , which then combine . Water extinguishment is thus a combination of `` asphyxia '' ( cutting off the oxygen supply ) and cooling .

Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air .

Lorca later asks Burnham to work for him , despite her sentence , explaining that he organized the circumstances that led her to him so she could help develop a new spore - based propulsion system that could win the war she started by killing T\\'Kuvma .

Lorca has Stamets make 133 micro-jumps in order to provide a three - dimensional reading of the sensors , while Burnham distracts Kol by challenging him to a fight . The jumps are completed , though not without trauma to Stamets . When the algorithm is calculated , Burnham , Tyler , Cornwell , and L\\'Rell ( who wishes to defect ) are transported back to the Discovery and the Klingon ship is destroyed .

       "  'gold_ctx': \"<P> The first modern usage of the specific term `` social justice '' is typically attributed to Catholic thinkers from the 1840s , including the Jesuit Luigi Taparelli in Civiltà Cattolica , based on the work of St. Thomas Aquinas . He argued that rival capitalist and socialist theories , based on subjective Cartesian thinking , undermined the unity of society present in Thomistic metaphysics as neither were sufficiently concerned with moral philosophy . Writing in 1861 , the influential British philosopher and economist , John Stuart Mill stated in Utilitarianism his view that `` Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it , that is , who have deserved equally well absolutely . This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice ; towards which all institutions , and the efforts of all virtuous citizens , should be made in the utmost degree to converge .

       "  'gold_ctx': \"<P> When the National Anthem was first recognized by law in 1932 , there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing . On June 22 , 1942 , the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing , while others should simply stand at attention , men removing their hats . ( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart . After 9 / 11 , the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the Anthem became nearly universal . </P>\",\n",
