# Tutorials

Just some example codes showing how to do certain things.

- `tutorial.ipynb`: Basic LLM code and getting logits, performing generate, etc.
- `hidden_state_tutorial.ipynb`: Accessing the hidden states using "hooks".
- `modify_and_propagate.ipynb`: An attempt at modifying hidden states during inference (a useful concept in activation steering).
